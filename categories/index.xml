      <description>Turing I am available to support Turing-based students in the following areas:
 Managing student-supervisor relationships. I have supervised numerous students to completion but I am also young enough to still remember what being a student is like! Happy to provide a helpful ear or work on strategies with you. Career planning. There are great careers out there but maximising your opportunities requires early thought and planning. Get ahead. Fellowship/job application review.</description>

      <description>Overview Our research is primarily concerned with the development of statistical and machine learning methodologies with a particular focus on applications in the biomedical sciences.
A complete list of publications can be found on Google Scholar and our research software is available on Github
Cancer Tumour heterogeneity describes the genetic diversity both within (intra-tumour heterogeniety) and between tumours (inter-tumour heterogeneity). Genetic differences within and between tumours give rise to different disease outcomes and patient responses to therapies.</description>
