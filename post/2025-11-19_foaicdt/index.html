      <p>What are the <em>fundamentals of artificial intelligence</em>?</p>
<p>This was the question I was faced with when I began my role as Co-Director of the Ellison Institute of Technology funded Centre for Doctoral Training in Fundamentals of Artificial Intelligence (FoAI CDT) at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>But, before I delve into it, let&rsquo;s start with some background &hellip;</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eit.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ellison Institute of Technology</a> (EIT) is a new research organisation that opened in the Oxford Science Park in 2024. It has developed a <a href="">major strategic partnership</a> with the University of Oxford which will see the two organisations collaborating on a range of scientific research and training programmes. EIT</p>
<h2 id="trends-in-modern-artificial-intelligence">Trends in modern artificial intelligence</h2>
<p>The landscape of AI research has changed in recent years, there is now more focus on:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Huge datasets</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Requirement for lots of compute</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Engineering of very big models (Large Language Models and other Foundation Models)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Emergence of new issues such as mechanistic interpretability and post-hoc reasoning strategies which are direct consequences</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There is broadly a lack of strong theoretical frameworks that have practical applicability by which to inform design and give insight into behaviours</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition the landscape is more diverse and heterogeneous as demonstrated by the tens of thousands of submissions to leading AI conferences</p>
<h2 id="the-challenge-for-universities">The challenge for universities</h2>
<p>There is a major challenge to develop a doctoral training programme in artificial intelligence:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>lack of resources compared to major (and sometimes even small) tech companies</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reacting to the speed and scale of the field</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>massive talent transfer from academia to industry</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sometimes seen to not being on the leading edge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>and what does it mean for a PhD student to function in a world where LLMs are beginning to emerge with capabilities on a level of the qualification they wish to achieve?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Need for universities to focus on their unique selling point (USP), we are institutions for learning and education.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>if university research leads to technologies, companies and real-world impact, great</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>but as a university our core contribution ultimately lies in the quality of our graduates and the demand for them by industry</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to produce graduates who have ways of thinking and a thirst for learning that will sustain them for a lifetime and be the foundation of not just one career but potentially many careers during their working life</p>
<h2 id="focusing-students">Focusing students</h2>
<p>Research students, particularly the best ones, are ambitious and energetic. They want to change the world. But how can we make them more likely to do that? We want to impart knowledge from previous generations. What was successful, what was not? Many research students, eager to just start doing stuff, often end up reinventing the wheel or making the same mistakes as previous generations.</p>
<h2 id="we-cannot-teach-you-how-to-do-research-in-ai">We cannot teach you how to do research in AI</h2>
<p>How to conduct AI research cannot be taught, it needs to be experienced</p>
<p>We designed a programme to help students gain familiarity with different concepts both old and new</p>
<h2 id="our-programme">Our programme</h2>
<p>This year, our programme in fact started with the History of AI. AI didn&rsquo;t start 10 years ago, but decades before.</p>
<p>We set our students a task during induction to work in groups to research the history of an AI topic.</p>
<p>Modern artificial intelligence technology allows the crafting of complex systems often without a need to understand the mathematical and computational principles upon which they are built. Yet, it can be increasingly argued that a thorough and rigorous understanding of those principles is now more important than ever in order to understand the intended and unintended behaviours of the systems we are creating.</p>
<h2 id="starting-with-learning">Starting with learning</h2>
<h2 id="a-bayesian-classic">A Bayesian Classic</h2>
<p>Oxford has a strong association with Bayesian methods and we have a large number of researchers who have including Professor Chris Holmes, Yee Whey Teh and Arnaud Doucet to name just a few. In recent years, Bayesian Statistics has had to evolve in the face of emerging AI technologies. While Bayesian thinking forms an axiomatically consistent framework for probabilistic reasoning, these guarantees only hold in the absence of model misspecification and that efficient and effective numerical-based inference is available. Neither are necessarily true in reality particularly for large-scale problems. Recent work in Generalised Bayesian Updating</p>
<p>Teaching this is not straightforward. Not all of our students would have studied measure theory before and know what a martingale is so this required a 15 minute sojourn into measure theory and a quick high-level definition of concepts.</p>
<p>In this module, we will discuss a series of fundamental concepts that underpin how modern machine learning models are constructed and their utility measured. We will explore how these fundamental concepts can be widely misunderstood and how such concepts are still active research topics.</p>
<p>The module will be divided into four parts: Learning theory, Bayesian methods, Causal methods and Measuring Performance.</p>
<p>Learning Theory</p>
<p>The fundamental concepts of bias/variance and approximation/estimation are well-covered in many university courses on learning theory. Yet, in practice, these distinct concepts are often used incorrectly and confused with one another even by supposedly well-practiced researchers. Students will review these concepts, develop a rigorous understanding of their definitions and develop a continued importance of these concepts in modern AI research.</p>
<p>Bayesian Methods</p>
<p>There is widespread familiarity with Bayesian Statistics in terms of its ability to provide a framework for uncertainty quantification and the utility of being able to specify priors. In this course, students will be introduced to the rich history of Bayesian thinking, deep theoretical concepts and more recent generalisations that have modernised Bayesian thinking in the age of AI.</p>
<p>Causal Methods</p>
<p>Students will be introduced to the Fundamentals of Causality in AI, providing them with tools for rigorous reasoning about cause and effect. Topics include causal graphs, interventions, counterfactuals, and methods for causal inference from observational data. The course emphasises both theoretical underpinnings (e.g. identifiability) and practical applications in machine learning and healthcare. Through lectures and hands-on exercises, students will develop the ability to critically assess causal claims, understand common pitfalls, and appreciate the role of causality in advancing trustworthy AI systems.</p>
<p>Measuring Performance</p>
<p>Determining the empirical performance of algorithms is an essential part of modern AI research. Metrics are used to summarise algorithmic performance and a variety of these exist. In this course, we will examine the performance metrics used in time-to-event analysis and highlight theoretical and practical challenges with the use of these metrics for measuring the performance of time-to-event prediction models.</p>
<p>Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, students will:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand core learning theory concepts concerning the relationship between bias/variance and approximation/estimation.</li>
<li>Be able to recall the principles of probabilistic model (Bayesian) construction</li>
<li>Recognise when causal inference is appropriate and understand fundamental limitations of purely statistical approaches.</li>
<li>How to critically evaluate model performance in terms of the assumptions, benefits, and limitations of common performance metrics</li>
</ul>
<p>Learning Outcomes
Students will demonstrate their understanding by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explaining expected risk minimisation (ERM) as the theoretical foundation for machine learning optimisation</li>
<li>Decomposing prediction error into bias, variance, approximation, and estimation components and identifying which dominates in specific scenarios</li>
<li>Constructing coherent Bayesian models and explaining how violations of coherence lead to inconsistent inference</li>
<li>Distinguishing between prediction, association, and causal inference, and selecting appropriate methods for each</li>
<li>Analysing a machine learning performance metric, characterising its implicit assumptions and potential failure modes</li>
</ul>
