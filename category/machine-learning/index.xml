      <description>&lt;p&gt;A preprint of work by &lt;a href=&#34;../../authors/gadd&#34;&gt;Charles Gadd&lt;/a&gt; describing &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.08.04.25332916v1&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;SurvivEHR: a competing risks, time-to-event foundation model for multiple long-term conditions from primary care electronic health records&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; is now available on medRxiv.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Multiple long-term conditions (MLTCs) or multimorbidity &amp;ndash; the co-occurrence of multiple chronic conditions &amp;ndash;presents a growing challenge for primary care. Current predictive models often target single outcomes and overlook the complexities of time-to-event risk in real-world, longitudinal health data. Here, we present SurvivEHR, a generative transformer-based foundation model trained on over 7.6 billion coded events from 23 million patients in UK primary care. SurvivEHR introduces a competing risk time-to-event pretraining objective that enables accurate forecasting of future diagnoses, investigations, medications, and mortality. We demonstrate that SurvivEHR achieves strong risk stratification performance, captures clinically meaningful trajectories, and outperforms benchmark survival models across multiple tasks. The model also transfers effectively to fine-tuned prognostic tasks, particularly in low-resource settings. By learning patient trajectories directly from routine health records, SurvivEHR offers a scalable and privacy-preserving approach for building generalisable clinical risk tools that address the complexity of MLTCs in primary care..&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to &lt;a href=&#34;../../authors/xing&#34;&gt;Hanwen Xing&lt;/a&gt; on having his paper &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61165-7&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;GPerturb: Gaussian process modelling of single-cell perturbation data&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; accepted in Nature Communications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Single-cell RNA sequencing and CRISPR screening enable high-throughput analysis of genetic perturbations at single-cell resolution. Understanding combinatorial perturbation effects is essential but challenging due to data sparsity and complex biological mechanisms. We present GPerturb, a Gaussian process-based sparse perturbation regression model designed to estimate gene-level perturbation effects. GPerturb employs an additive structure to separate signal from noise and captures sparse, interpretable effects from both discrete and continuous responses. It also provides uncertainty estimates for the presence and strength of perturbation effects on individual genes. We demonstrate the use GPerturb on both simulated and real-world datasets, characterising its competitive performance with current state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the model reveals meaningful gene-perturbation interactions and identifies effects consistent with known biology. GPerturb offers a novel approach for uncovering complex dependencies between gene expression and perturbations and advancing our understanding of gene regulation at the single-cell level.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Christopher Yau has contributed as a member of the expert working group to a new report &lt;a href=&#34;2025-08-07_SurvivEHR_medrxiv.md&#34;&gt;&amp;ldquo;The Synthetic Data for Development of AI as a Medical Device&amp;rdquo;&lt;/a&gt; now available via PHG Foundation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Synthetic data is artificially generated data that reflects the properties and relationships found in real data. While synthetic data can play an important role in AIaMD development, its use in regulatory submissions introduces specific considerations, especially when it constitutes a substantial part of the evidence package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Synthetic Data for Development of AI as a Medical Device (AIaMDs) report, produced by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and the PHG Foundation, outlines these considerations, building on and complementing existing regulatory guidance. This marks an important and exciting first step for manufacturers and notified bodies collectively navigating this evolving landscape. The report provides crucial groundwork, though more work is required to move past these preliminary ideas.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to &lt;a href=&#34;../../authors/kim&#34;&gt;Woojung Kim&lt;/a&gt; on having his paper accepted at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.mlforhc.org/2024-abstracts&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;ML4H 2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This paper introduces the Mixed Type Multimorbidity Variational Autoencoder (M3VAE), a deep probabilistic generative model developed for supervised dimensionality reduction in the context of multimorbidity analysis. The model is designed to overcome the limitations of purely supervised or unsupervised approaches in this field. M3VAE focuses on identifying latent representations of mixed-type health-related attributes essential for predicting patient survival outcomes. It integrates datasets with multiple modalities (by which we mean data of multiple types), encompassing health measurements, demographic details, and (potentially censored) survival outcomes. A key feature of M3VAE is its ability to reconstruct latent representations that exhibit clustering patterns, thereby revealing important patterns in disease co-occurrence. This functionality provides insights for understanding and predicting health outcomes. The efficacy of M3VAE has been demonstrated through experiments with both synthetic and real-world electronic health record data, showing its capability in identifying interpretable morbidity groupings related to future survival outcomes. The paper is available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://openreview.net/pdf/07ab0f2b2f529cdf9ca9d18dcad51c405ded4732.pdf&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;OpenReview&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to &lt;a href=&#34;../../authors/gadd&#34;&gt;Charles Gadd&lt;/a&gt; on having his paper accepted at &lt;a href=&#34;https://sites.google.com/cs.washington.edu/mlcb2024/home?authuser=0&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;MLCB 2024&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Changes in the number of copies of certain parts of the genome, known as copy number alterations (CNAs), due to somatic mutation processes are a hallmark of many cancers. This genomic complexity is known to be associated with poorer outcomes for patients but describing its contribution in detail has been difficult. Copy number alterations can affect large regions spanning whole chromosomes or the entire genome itself but can also be localised to only small segments of the genome and no methods exist that allow this multi-scale nature to be quantified. In this paper, we address this using Wave-LSTM, a signal decomposition approach designed to capture the multi-scale structure of complex whole genome copy number profiles. Using wavelet-based source separation in combination with deep learning-based attention mechanisms. We show that Wave-LSTM can be used to derive multi-scale representations from copy number profiles which can be used to decipher sub-clonal structures from single-cell copy number data and to improve survival prediction performance from patient tumour profiles.&lt;/p&gt;

      <guid>https://cwcyau.github.io/post/2023-12-13_rarity_2023/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to &lt;a href=&#34;../../authors/martens&#34;&gt;Kaspar Martens&lt;/a&gt; on having his paper accepted in &lt;a href=&#34;https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/39/12/btad750/7471872?login=false&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Bioinformatics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cell type identification plays an important role in the analysis and interpretation of single-cell data and can be carried out via supervised or unsupervised clustering approaches. Supervised methods are best suited where we can list all cell types and their respective marker genes a priori, while unsupervised clustering algorithms look for groups of cells with similar expression properties. This property permits the identification of both known and unknown cell populations, making unsupervised methods suitable for discovery. Success is dependent on the relative strength of the expression signature of each group as well as the number of cells. Rare cell types therefore present a particular challenge that is magnified when they are defined by differentially expressing a small number of genes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Typical unsupervised approaches fail to identify such rare subpopulations, and these cells tend to be absorbed into more prevalent cell types. In order to balance these competing demands, we have developed a novel statistical framework for unsupervised clustering, named Rarity, that enables the discovery process for rare cell types to be more robust, consistent, and interpretable. We achieve this by devising a novel clustering method based on a Bayesian latent variable model in which we assign cells to inferred latent binary on/off expression profiles. This lets us achieve increased sensitivity to rare cell populations while also allowing us to control and interpret potential false positive discoveries. We systematically study the challenges associated with rare cell type identification and demonstrate the utility of Rarity on various IMC datasets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Implementation of Rarity together with examples is available from the Github repository (&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kasparmartens/rarity%29&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;https://github.com/kasparmartens/rarity)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Congratulations to &lt;a href=&#34;../../authors/nulsen&#34;&gt;Joel Nulsen&lt;/a&gt; on having his paper accepted in &lt;a href=&#34;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12859-023-05576-7&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;BMC Bioinformatics&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Genomic insights in settings where tumour sample sizes are limited to just hundreds or even tens of cells hold great clinical potential, but also present significant technical challenges. We previously developed the DigiPico sequencing platform to accurately identify somatic mutations from such samples.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here, we complete this genomic characterisation with copy number. We present a novel protocol, PicoCNV, to call allele-specific somatic copy number alterations from picogram quantities of tumour DNA. We find that PicoCNV provides exactly accurate copy number in 84% of the genome for even the smallest samples, and demonstrate its clinical potential in maintenance therapy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;PicoCNV complements our existing platform, allowing for accurate and comprehensive genomic characterisations of cancers in settings where only microscopic samples are available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Generative models for multimodal data permit the identification of latent factors that may be associated with important determinants of observed data heterogeneity. Common or shared factors could be important for explaining variation across modalities whereas other factors may be private and important only for the explanation of a single modality. Multimodal Variational Autoencoders, such as MVAE and MMVAE, are a natural choice for inferring those underlying latent factors and separating shared variation from private. In this work, we investigate their capability to reliably perform this disentanglement. In particular, wehighlight a challenging problem setting where modality-specific variation dominates the shared signal. Taking a cross-modal prediction perspective, we demonstrate limitations of existing models, and propose a modification how to make them more robust to modalityspecific variation. Our findings are supported by experiments on synthetic as well as various real-world multi-omics data sets. The paper is available on &lt;a href=&#34;https://proceedings.mlr.press/v240/martens24a.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;PMLR&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Great UK PhD Data Science Survey</title>

      <pubDate>Tue, 05 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://cwcyau.github.io/post/greatphdsurvey/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What am I doing?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My name is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.wrh.ox.ac.uk/team/christoper-yau&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Christopher Yau&lt;/a&gt; and I am Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.ox.ac.uk&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;University of Oxford&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Health Data Research UK&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am carrying out a &lt;a href=&#34;https://forms.gle/u55swJNChHbaKMMS6&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;survey&lt;/a&gt; of UK PhD students who are working in any area of data science and I need your help! We hope to get survey responses from over 300 PhD students so please help us by sparing 10-15 minutes of your time to answer some questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Responses received before &lt;strong&gt;15 July 2022&lt;/strong&gt; will be entered into a prize draw for a selection of £30 Amazon eGift cards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After 30 July 2022, data gathered through the survey will be analysed and a written report produced for distribution in September 2022.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why another survey?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The purpose of this survey is to improve our understanding of your motivations for doing a PhD, what you want to and are getting out of it, and where you want to go next. We know the world looks very different for data scientists than when I was doing my PhD so, with many exciting and lucrative opportunities coming from different parts of the ecosystem, what is the purpose of the PhD? What makes it an attractive qualification to have still?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We know that the experience of PhD students varies due to several factors but – as data scientists - we need more detailed data to better understand and quantitatively characterise those variations. The survey information that will be collected will help us inform discussions with universities and funders to develop new strategies and approaches for doctoral training in the UK and to cater for changing needs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What is the definition of data science being used? Who should take part?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you spend a large part of your research analysing real-world data, building computational models, or developing novel computer algorithms for analysing data then you should complete this survey. It does not matter if you are working on proteins, geology, or plasma physics, if it involves data then please complete this survey. If you largely work on theory and/or simulations relevant to data science but not much with data itself, we are keen to hear from you too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Are there questions you’ve forgotten?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We tried to include as many questions as possible without making the survey too laborious. There are many issues and topics we could have addressed but we made tough choices to focus on these key areas of interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why is the last section only on health?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This survey is being conducted in partnership with Health Data Research UK – the national institute for health data research. They have a particular focus on health data science and consequently we have added a few questions on this area of work. However, though the findings will be directly linked to health data science, the responses should reveal insights into how inter-/multi-disciplinary research and career transitions are being supported.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What about stipends and the cost-of-living crisis?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are deeply aware that UK PhD students are struggling with the current cost-of-living crisis and the impact of the real terms reduction in spending power offered by typical studentship stipends. We are not able to affect the decisions that must be taken by funders to address these issues but we hope that the survey information could shed light on some of the wider challenges faced by students in addition to financial support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why only UK?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We would love to conduct a global survey but academic systems across the globe work quite differently and, as UK-based researchers working in the UK, it seems fitting that we would explore the nation in which we live.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What will you do with the data?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We will use the survey data to generate a report detailing our survey findings by September 2022. This will be disseminated publicly. All surveys are collected anonymously except where individuals choose to provide their name and e-mail address to be entered for the prize draw. Names and e-mail addresses submitted will only be used for this purpose and will not be shared for the analysis of the main survey data or for distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Christopher Yau has supported Health Data Research UK (HDRUK) PhD students Fabian Falck and Haoting Zhang in the development of work that has now been published as a paper at the NeurIPS 2021 conference. The work entitled &lt;a href=&#34;https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2021/hash/48cb136b65a69e8c2aa22913a0d91b2f-Abstract.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Multi-Facet Clustering Variational Autoencoders&lt;/a&gt; is a novel class of variational autoencoders with a hierarchy of latent variables, each with a Mixture-of-Gaussians prior, that learns multiple clusterings simultaneously, and is trained fully unsupervised and end-to-end. Chris, who directs the HDRUK PhD programme, writes about the work of the students in this &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.hdruk.ac.uk/news/the-different-facets-of-data/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>New study in American Journal of Drug Alcohol Abuse</title>
      <link>https://cwcyau.github.io/post/2021-01-11_opioid/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 11 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>https://cwcyau.github.io/post/2021-01-11_opioid/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Increasing rates of opioid-related overdose have been identified globally. Treatment for opioid use disorders (OUD) includes medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD) alongside behavioral support. In this study we use statistical analysis and machine learning to show that the Breaking Free Online program may reduce opioid use and improve biopsychosocial functioning in individuals with OUD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
