      <description>Overview Our research is primarily concerned with the development of statistical and machine learning methodologies with a particular focus on applications in the biomedical sciences.
A complete list of publications can be found on Google Scholar and our research software is available on Github
Cancer Tumour heterogeneity describes the genetic diversity both within (intra-tumour heterogeniety) and between tumours (inter-tumour heterogeneity). Genetic differences within and between tumours give rise to different disease outcomes and patient responses to therapies.</description>
