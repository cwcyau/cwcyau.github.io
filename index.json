Afterwards, I joined the EPSRC-funded Life Sciences Interface Doctoral Training Centre, led by Professor David Gavaghan in Oxford where I completed my doctoral thesis in Statistics under the supervision of Professor Chris Holmes.\nI subsequently took up MRC Fellowship in Biomedical Informatics before joining Imperial College London as a Lecturer in Statistics in the Department of Mathematics. I rejoined Oxford where I became Associate Professor in Genomic Medicine as a Principal Investigator at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics. I then became Reader and then Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Birmingham prior to joining Manchester.\nI sit on the development group for the Academy of Medical Science FLIER programme which I co-developed with the panel. I am also on the committee of the MRC Methodology Research Programme from April 2020. I co-lead the Machine Learning sub-domain for the Genomics England Clinical Interpretation Partnership in Quantitative Methods, Functional Genomics and Machine Learning.\nResearch Interests For many years, I have been interested in the development of novel statistical methods for solving a broad spectrum of biomedical problems from microscopy to genomics to mental health. Real problems inspired and underpin the methodological research I do and getting to grips with real scientific investigations and experiments grounds the research in reality.\nMy approach is normally Bayesian using formal probabilistic methods. This gives methods a coherent development framework allowing for greater rigour in model evaluation.\nI believe in a multi-disciplinary approach which involves working with and training not only statistical and machine learning scientists but also those from a biomedical, social science or clinical background.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"taxonomy","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://cwcyau.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Manchester and a Fellow at the Alan Turing Institute.

It is increasingly common as people live longer. It is important because individual illnesses have knock-on effects on others, it is more complex managing multiple than single illnesses, and multimorbid patients are heavy users of medications and health services.\nTo understand multimorbidity we need to know which illnesses tend to occur together and which illness combinations most affect health. To adapt health services we need to know which types of people develop multimorbidity: their age, sex, ethnicity, socio-economic status and whether they tend to live in the same households. To learn how to prevent it we need to identify lifestyle factors (physical activity, diet, smoking, alcohol) linked to multimorbidity and the measurements (laboratory test results, weight, blood pressure) that might be early signs.\nElectronic Health Records Electronic health records are a good source of information on multimorbidity because they include information on the same patient over many years. They include information on illnesses, medications, hospital admissions; measurements (laboratory tests, weight, blood pressure) and lifestyle (smoking, alcohol). Previous research has studied multimorbidity using a variety of statistical methods. It finds some illnesses, such as diabetes and heart disease tend to occur together. But different statistical methods often find different groups of illnesses. We need a single, consistent approach to this type of analysis to ensure we are researching the same groups of illnesses. Previous research generally has not made best use of all the available information. For example, patients are considered either to have or not have diabetes but research did not make use of laboratory measurements (such as blood glucose) identifying some people as likely to develop diabetes. Previous research grouped illnesses according to how commonly they occur together, without giving any special significance to combinations of illnesses linked to risk of death or hospital admission. Clearly such combinations of illness are of more importance. There are more advanced analysis methods which can address these and other shortcomings.\nThe Research The first part of our research will develop methods of data analysis. We will review research on different statistical methods for grouping illnesses together. We will hold a workshop involving leading UK researchers in the field to try to agree on the best approach to this type of analysis. Informed by this we will analyse two large databases of electronic health records, each including several million patients. In each database we will identify the groups of illnesses that co-occur and check our findings in the other database. This is considered good practice in analysis. At the end of this step we will produce software to analyse and find groups of illnesses in electronic health records and make this freely available for other researchers to use.\nThe next part of our research will use additional information from two large surveys. Both surveys include details not always available in health records e.g. occupation, diet, lifestyle and measures of frailty. One includes 500,000 people the other has information on the same people over a period of 14 years. We will describe the consequences for patients of different combinations of illnesses: their levels of frailty because it is linked to need for social care; development of further illnesses; medications, use of health services and death. We will work with patient advisors to help guide analysis of patients journeys through health services. We will investigate possible causes of multimorbidity including people's social circumstances, the environment, lifestyle (smoking, alcohol, diet and exercise) and laboratory test results that might help indicate causes. This step will point to the areas of environment and lifestyle which should be investigated further as possible causes.\n","date":1569888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569888000,"objectID":"59ffd5e228e6a0fd7be83744d3963a97","permalink":"https://cwcyau.github.io/project/birmcam/","publishdate":"2019-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/birmcam/","section":"project","summary":"Bringing Innovative Research Methods to Clustering Analysis of Multimorbidity  (BIRM-CAM) project between the Universities of Birmingham and Cambridge funded by the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR).","tags":["Multimorbidity","Electronic Health Records","Digital Health"],"title":"BIRM-CAM","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":["health data","phd"],"content":"The Wellcome Trust have funded a new HDRUK-Turing Wellcome PhD programme in Health Data Science which will be jointly directed by Christopher Yau.

New and maturing technological developments hold the potential to have a transformative effect on health service delivery. Digital health solutions can aid in the reduction of waiting times, more effective use of limited resources and improved treatment fidelity but, once such technologies are implemented, the dearth of data that can be acquired through their adoption itself presents a challenge. Data-driven insights, driven by machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, can offer a glimpse of previously unknown patterns and identify opportunities for the development of new healthcare practices or policies. As digital health platforms become more sophisticated, the data that can be acquired often becomes more complex and heterogeneous, machine-based interpretation becomes a near-necessity.\nThe Breaking Free Group is a leading digital health and behaviour science company. Founded in 2010, it is formed from a team of psychologists, substance misuse experts and technology specialists. With an organisational philosophy built around the principles of state-of-the-art behaviour science and the UK Medical Research Council evaluation framework, they have developed a bespoke digital behavioural intervention platform that provides 24/7 access to a secure, GDPR-compliant, online digital cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) platform with a particular focus on substance misuse. Users of the platform complete pre- and post-therapy questionnaires and interactive exercises designed to teach strategies to overcome addictive behaviours and improve wellbeing. Scoring on questionnaire responses can signpost users to personalised information sources. Real-time quantitative data from the platform can be anonymously fed to health service providers and commissioners for planning and policy development purposes.\nBreaking Free has seen its digital platform commissioned for use by the Ministry of Justice in UK prisons, Non-Government Charitable Organisations and NHS Trusts. Uniquely, Breaking Free operates under a research ethics protocol approved by the NHS Health Research Authority and endorsement by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence allowing the data they collect to be utilised for broader research applications. More recently, two new online platforms have been deployed more widely to the public targeting alcohol consumption reduction and smoking cessation. Breaking Free are based in both Birmingham and Manchester.\nWe have initiated a new multi-disciplinary collaboration with the Breaking Free Online team to develop novel data science methodologies to exploit real-time digital health monitoring and intervention data. Our working exemplars will be based on the unique behavioural insights captured by the Breaking Free Group but the research outputs would have generic applicability in other related settings including youth mental health conditions.\n","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"903e3bd34bc5715642cc1c577de6e9e9","permalink":"https://cwcyau.github.io/project/breaking-free/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/breaking-free/","section":"project","summary":"The Data Science of Digital Behaviour Intervention","tags":["Mental Health","Digital Health","Behavioural Science"],"title":"Breaking Free with Artificial Intelligence","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Mutation signatures are the hallmarks of mutagenic processes in cancer that can provide clues about the biochemical mechanisms by which DNA is altered in cancer.

Sparsity-inducing priors regularise the TF-gene interaction network and a Dirichlet process prior to regulate the number of participating TFs. This gives rise to a Bayesian nonparametric model where the number of TFs are learnt from data and not specified a priori. Statistical inference is performed in a Bayesian setting using an implementation of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)-derived No-U Turn Sampler (NUTS) in STAN.\nWe show that MONET is able to extract accurate time-dependent TF-gene interaction networks and assess the importance of each TF for the different stages in haematopoietic development.

Our goal is to decompose the feature-level variation in high-dimensional data through disentanglement of additive and interactions effects of latent variables and fixed inputs. We propose to achieve this through the Neural Decomposition - an adaptation of the well-known concept of variance decomposition from classical statistics to deep learning models.

Unlike recurrent alterations of known drivers, these cancer helper genes are rare or patient-specific. However, they converge towards perturbations of well-known cancer processes. Recurrence of the same process perturbations, rather than individual genes, divides EACs into six clusters differing in their molecular and clinical features.

We show that \\RLEvolution is able to deconvolve the sequence of complex events that may occur during cancer evolution using a combination of simulated and real-world cancer datasets.\nResearchers:\n  Yun Feng  ","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"0a5d15538c01e2be89b39609ffb5d5ee","permalink":"https://cwcyau.github.io/project/rlevolution/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/rlevolution/","section":"project","summary":"Unravelling the history of genomic instability through deep reinforcement learning.","tags":["Deep Learning","Explainable Algorithms","Genomics","Cancer","Machine Learning"],"title":"RLevolution","type":"project"},{"authors":["D Murray","Hayden Pearce","Wayne Croft","Chris Yau","Paul Moss","Julia Scarisbrick"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"06ddd1956e41a6fa90c4b11b2bedb5c7","permalink":"https://cwcyau.github.io/publication/2019-01-01_murray2019single/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-01-01_murray2019single/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Single-cell RNA sequencing with TCR repertoire profiling of mycosis fungoides","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Mathematical models of disease evolution seek to specify the complex mechanistic relationships between many measurable quantities over space and time. However, as our capability to generate experimental data improves, our ability to conceive of appropriate mathematical descriptions to describe biological phenomena has become a bottleneck.\nThe goal of machine learning is to “learn” complex dependencies automatically within data sets. Neural networks (NNs) have been at the forefront of recent advances by offering a means of parametrising complex functional mapping between data and its representations.\nNovel computational machinery have enabled NN approaches to scale to the analysis of unprecedently large datasets and provide versatility over standard modelling approaches. However, despite their successes in a range of applications, in biomedical research, NNs are often derided for their “black box” discoveries, lack of interpretability and the need for unrealistic quantities of training data. Such criticisms often overlook the fact that default NN structures express no explicit assumptions about the problems on which they are applied and they are often used as generic data mining devices for discovery purposes.\nNonetheless, there is a clear opportunity for the development of novel NN approaches that combine scalability and versatility with the capability of learning the physically realistic constraints that are embedded in hand-crafted mathematical models.\nThis project seeks to investigate the methodological foundations for what could form an Automated BioData Scientist (AutoBioDataSci) platform. We would like to develop learning algorithms that can capture biological laws and encapsulate them in such a way that such knowledge can be transfer to new problems. This major project involves inter-linking representation learning theory with transfer and meta-learning as well as having its roots embedded in the biological scientific discovery process.\nResearchers:\n  Dominic Danks  Kaspar Maertens

the Ovarian Cancer Cell Laboratory led by Professor Ahmed Ahsour Ahmed to unlock the molecular mechanisms underlying high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) using genomics and bioinformatics.\nPremalignant SOX2 overexpression in the fallopian tubes of ovarian cancer patients We have discovered premalignant overexpression of SOX2 in the fallopian tubes of ovarian cancer patients which was nearly ubiquitous in HGSOCs. This was also a common feature in women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations prior to ovarian cancer initiation. Thus, our data has important implications for screening, although it will need additional clinical evaluation to test the feasibility of quantitative detection of SOX2 expression or the expression of its downstream targets for this purpose. You can read the original research paper here as well as media reports here and here.\nThe unmasking non-genetic heterogeneity through by single-cell sequencing of fallopian tube epithelial cells More recently, we have used single cell sequencing to understand the inter-differentiation between cell states which promotes cancer cell survival under stress and fosters non-genetic heterogeneity (NGH). NGH is a surrogate of tumor resilience but its quantification is confounded by genetic heterogeneity. We showed that NGH can be accurately measured when informed by the molecular signatures of the normal cells of origin. We surveyed the transcriptomes of 4000 normal fallopian tube epithelial (FTE) cells, the cells of origin of serous ovarian cancer, and identified six FTE subtypes. We used subtype signatures to deconvolute SOC expression data and found substantial intra-tumor NGH that was previously unrecognized. Importantly, NGH-based stratification of ∼1700 tumors robustly predicted survival. Our findings lay the foundation for accurate prognostic and therapeutic stratification of SOC.
