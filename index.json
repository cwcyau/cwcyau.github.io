[{"authors":["admin"],"categories":null,"content":"I am Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Oxford in a joint position between Nuffield Department for Women\u0026rsquo;s and Reproductive Health and the Nuffield Department of Population Health. My group is based at the Big Data Institute. I am also Director of the Health Data Research-Alan Turing Institute Wellcome PhD programme in Health Data Science and a recipient of the UKRI Turing Artificial Intelligence Fellowship.\nAbout Me I studied undergraduate Engineering at Cambridge where I did my masters dissertation with Professor Andrew Blake at Microsoft Research on digital image analysis. Afterwards, I joined the EPSRC-funded Life Sciences Interface Doctoral Training Centre, led by Professor David Gavaghan in Oxford where I completed my doctoral thesis in Statistics under the supervision of Professor Chris Holmes.\nI subsequently took up MRC Fellowship in Biomedical Informatics before joining Imperial College London as a Lecturer in Statistics in the Department of Mathematics. I rejoined Oxford where I became Associate Professor in Genomic Medicine as a Principal Investigator at the Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics. I then became Reader and then Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Birmingham and the University of Manchester before returning to Oxford.\nI am a member of the MRC Better Methods, Better Research Programme Panel (formerly the Methodology Research Panel) and the Millenium Medal committee. I lead the Genomics England Clinical Interpretation Partnership in Quantitative Methods, Functional Genomics and Machine Learning. I am also a consultant for Kheiron Medical Technologies, the Medicines \u0026amp; Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and Singula Bio. I was previously on the Taskforce group for the Academy of Medical Science FLIER programme.\nResearch Interests For many years, I have been interested in the development of novel statistical methods for solving a broad spectrum of biomedical problems from microscopy to genomics to mental health. Real problems inspired and underpin the methodological research I do and getting to grips with real scientific investigations and experiments grounds the research in reality.\nMy approach is normally Bayesian using formal probabilistic methods. This gives methods a coherent development framework allowing for greater rigour in model evaluation.\nI believe in a multi-disciplinary approach which involves working with and training not only statistical and machine learning scientists but also those from a biomedical, social science or clinical background.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://cwcyau.github.io/authors/admin/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/authors/admin/","section":"authors","summary":"I am Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Oxford in a joint position between Nuffield Department for Women\u0026rsquo;s and Reproductive Health and the Nuffield Department of Population Health.

Through early detection, it may be possible to take actions to minimise future disease severity or even prevent disease occurrence altogether. However, while the general concept is readily accepted, putting early detection into practice is often far from straightforward.\nIn this post, I will outline some ideas that can underpin a conceptual framework for developing early detection markers and point out some common mistakes. This is intended to provide a non-technical guide to some principles that might stimulate suitable study designs in the future.\nDisease progression First, I will introduce some terminology to make this discussion clearer. There will be frequent use of the phrase disease progression to describe how a condition begins and typically worsens over time. I will also use the term disease state to refer to the severity of a condition at any one moment in time. Therefore, as a disease progresses, the disease state changes. I will often refer to four different phases of disease progression:\nPre-disease which describes the period before the onset of the condition. Early stage disease which covers the period between the onset of the disease and the earliest signs that the condition may have started to manifest. Established disease typically describing the period when patients would likely be first diagnosed after clear symptoms have appeared and treatment is necessary. Finally, late stage disease which occurs after the disease has evolved and new courses of treatments are required. The long-term quality of life for the patient maybe severely diminished. The type of diseases that we will be thinking about are chronic conditions (e.g. dementia) or disorders such as cancer. Short-term conditions are not part of this discussion.\nDetecting disease Identifying a disease requires the ability to measure some quantity, known as a marker, which is related to the disease state. The marker can be directly related to the disease, e.g. the size of a tumour on a CT scan, or an indirect marker such as an assessment of cognitive abilities in individuals with dementia. Markers that can directly measure disease state are preferred but indirect measurements may be the only pragmatic option in many situations.\nThe detection window refers to the period when the magnitude of the marker exceeds a threshold and it is possible to detect the presence (or absence) of the marker (i.e. the minimum size of a breast tumour that can be seen on a mammogram). The detection window should be as wide as possible to give the best chance of picking up the disease. For early detection, it is necessary for the detection window to overlap with the early onset of the disease and the opportunity window which is the period during which it maybe possible to intervene and influence the course of the disease progression (ideally, prevent it).\nFigure 1. An illustration of the terminology used in this article with the four phases of disease progression and the ideal placing of the opportunity and detection windows to enable early detection of disease. Types of early detection markers In terms of their potential for early detection, disease markers can broadly be classified into one of two forms (i) progressive and (ii) transient markers.\nProgressive markers track the progression of the disease from early-onset to late-stage (Figure 1). They increase (or decrease) over time with the severity of the condition and do not ordinarily improve unless there is some medical intervention. The detection window opens as soon as the markers exceeds a certain threshold and does not close. For early detection, progressive markers should reach the detection threshold during the early phases of the disease giving the largest detection window possible.\nFigure 2. Progressive markers gradually increase as the disease worsens, activating early during disease progression to give a large detection window that maximises the chance of overlapping with the opportunity window. Transient markers are linked to features of the disease that are only active during certain periods of disease progression. The detection window is therefore bounded by both the period in which the marker is active and the detection threshold. As with progressive markers, the detection window for a transient marker ideally occupies an early phase of disease and overlaps the opportunity window.\nFigure 3. An ideal transient marker activates at an early disease stage and during the opportunity window. Common mistakes Not all valid markers are \u0026ldquo;early detection markers\u0026rdquo; When developing a marker for early detection it is absolutely crucial to understand the corresponding detection window and its relation to the opportunity window. For progressive markers, if the detection window does not overlap with early disease on-set and/or the opportunity window, the progression marker cannot be used to prompt early intervention. This can occur if the detection threshold is too high or the marker signal does not activate until the disease is well-established.\nFigure 4. Examples of unsuitable progressive markers for early detection. Top: the detection threshold is too high and the disease cannot be determined before the opportunity window ends. Bottom: The markers does not switch on until the opportunity window ends. If a transient marker is only active fleetingly this may leave an impractically short opportunity window which is not large enough to realistically catch patients at that critical moment of their disease progression.\nFigure 5. Unsuitable transient markers for early detection. Many investigations of early detection markers often fail to acknowledge that not all valid progressive or transient markers are suitable for early detection and characterising these properly can reduce wasted effort later on.\nCase-control discovery A frequently used approach to identifying early detection markers is to compare a group of individuals with late stage disease (cases) and to those with early stage disease (controls). Markers that differ between the groups are then candidate early detection markers. However, this approach is limited, since without any individuals occupying the intermediate stages of disease progression it is not possible to determine the detection window associated with the marker. The case-control study only tells us that the markers begin low in one group, and are high in the other. It does not tell us how quickly the marker reaches the detection threshold and therefore what the detection window is.\nFigure 6. Early and late-stage patient comparisons can yield potential progressive markers but the full dynamic behaviour of the markers cannot be revealed without information from additional individuals occupying the intermediate stage of disease progression. Therefore the use of case-control type studies to identify early detection markers must be followed by validation studies to examine the dynamics of the potential markers to confirm and characterise their detection windows relative to the opportunity window.\nAssociation is not prediction Another issue with case-control studies is that some investigations often confuse association with prediction. Association in these instances means that there are markers which are more (or less) likely to occur in the case population than in the control population. For example, there may be 40 in 1,000 late stage disease individuals who have a high-level of a blood protein marker, but only 5 in 1,000 early-stage individuals. We can then hypothesise that there may be an association of this marker with late-stage disease. It is tempting to extrapolate to this meaning that this is candidate early disease marker but extreme caution must be exercised.\nFigure 7. The green marker is present in most cases but hardly in any controls. A test based on this marker would give you high confidence about its results. The pink marker is associated with more cases than controls but if used as a basis for a test, our confidence in the results would not be very high. First, what are the absolute numbers? Does the marker appear sufficiently often enough in the disease population to actually be practically useful? In this example, most individuals did not have the marker present. Can we narrow down those members of the population where the marker is more likely to be present? This might require a further study. Second, what is the predictive value of the marker? As described before, the case-control study highlights differences between your two groups of individuals but it does not tell you how the marker behaves in any individual over time.\nChoosing an appropriate comparator Many investigations of early disease markers often use a seemingly obvious control group - individuals with no or early stage disease - but this may not be appropriate. For example, suppose we are examining whether changes in an individual\u0026rsquo;s retail spending patterns (e.g. store or credit card history) can be used to predict future cancer occurrence. It is reasonable to hypothesise that individuals with cancer could have exhibited early symptoms that led to more frequent purchases of off-the-shelf medications and health related products (e.g. pain relief, constipation relief, natural remedies). We might then wish to compare spend patterns between those with and without a cancer diagnosis. If a pattern exists, this signal could be exploited for early detection.\nFigure 8. The frequency of retail encounters from store card record could be tested for their predictive utility of future cancer diagnosis. Comparisons can be made as a naive control consisting of individuals who do not have cancer but also a robust control set containing individuals who have other conditions. However, this approach excludes the possibility that changes in spending patterns could be induced by other, non-cancer conditions. While the spending pattern could clearly discriminate between those with and without cancer, is it specific enough to differentiate those who have cancer from someone who has a chronic but non-serious condition (such as irritable bowel syndrome)? Choosing the right comparator is important for determining the real-world utility of the putative early detection marker. In this example, a spending pattern which is induced by cancer but is not specific to cancer has limited utility due to the number of false alarms it could cause.\nDiscussion The early detection of disease is a highly appealing and potentially extremely impactful. In this post I tried to describe aspects of how I think about the problem and discussed some conceptual ideas for developing early detection approaches. Some of these ideas seem quite obvious, yet surprisingly a number of studies fall foul of them nonetheless. Grappling with these concepts (and more that I did not have time to elaborate on) is critical to conducting effective research and development of early detection technologies, minimise wastage and ensuring resources are only focused on the most sound ideas.\nAcknowledgements Thanks to Dona Reddiar, Kieran Campbell, Max Little, David Wong and Anthony Chan for reading early drafts of this text.\n","date":1683590400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683590400,"objectID":"8617c72125c07e24eea97fb7fe9d639d","permalink":"https://cwcyau.github.io/post/earlydetection/","publishdate":"2023-05-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/earlydetection/","section":"post","summary":"The early detection of diseases is a highly desirable approach for addressing conditions where late stage disease cannot be easily treated or managed.

We hope to get survey responses from over 300 PhD students so please help us by sparing 10-15 minutes of your time to answer some questions.\nResponses received before 15 July 2022 will be entered into a prize draw for a selection of £30 Amazon eGift cards.\nAfter 30 July 2022, data gathered through the survey will be analysed and a written report produced for distribution in September 2022.\nWhy another survey?\nThe purpose of this survey is to improve our understanding of your motivations for doing a PhD, what you want to and are getting out of it, and where you want to go next. We know the world looks very different for data scientists than when I was doing my PhD so, with many exciting and lucrative opportunities coming from different parts of the ecosystem, what is the purpose of the PhD? What makes it an attractive qualification to have still?\nWe know that the experience of PhD students varies due to several factors but – as data scientists - we need more detailed data to better understand and quantitatively characterise those variations. The survey information that will be collected will help us inform discussions with universities and funders to develop new strategies and approaches for doctoral training in the UK and to cater for changing needs.\nWhat is the definition of data science being used? Who should take part?\nIf you spend a large part of your research analysing real-world data, building computational models, or developing novel computer algorithms for analysing data then you should complete this survey. It does not matter if you are working on proteins, geology, or plasma physics, if it involves data then please complete this survey. If you largely work on theory and/or simulations relevant to data science but not much with data itself, we are keen to hear from you too.\nAre there questions you’ve forgotten?\nWe tried to include as many questions as possible without making the survey too laborious. There are many issues and topics we could have addressed but we made tough choices to focus on these key areas of interest.\nWhy is the last section only on health?\nThis survey is being conducted in partnership with Health Data Research UK – the national institute for health data research. They have a particular focus on health data science and consequently we have added a few questions on this area of work. However, though the findings will be directly linked to health data science, the responses should reveal insights into how inter-/multi-disciplinary research and career transitions are being supported.\nWhat about stipends and the cost-of-living crisis?\nWe are deeply aware that UK PhD students are struggling with the current cost-of-living crisis and the impact of the real terms reduction in spending power offered by typical studentship stipends. We are not able to affect the decisions that must be taken by funders to address these issues but we hope that the survey information could shed light on some of the wider challenges faced by students in addition to financial support.\nWhy only UK?\nWe would love to conduct a global survey but academic systems across the globe work quite differently and, as UK-based researchers working in the UK, it seems fitting that we would explore the nation in which we live.\nWhat will you do with the data?\nWe will use the survey data to generate a report detailing our survey findings by September 2022. This will be disseminated publicly. All surveys are collected anonymously except where individuals choose to provide their name and e-mail address to be entered for the prize draw. Names and e-mail addresses submitted will only be used for this purpose and will not be shared for the analysis of the main survey data or for distribution.\n","date":1656979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656979200,"objectID":"3298e69d3e1e283ef80a584bfcff81a2","permalink":"https://cwcyau.github.io/post/greatphdsurvey/","publishdate":"2022-07-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/greatphdsurvey/","section":"post","summary":"What am I doing?\nMy name is Christopher Yau and I am Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Oxford and Health Data Research UK.\nI am carrying out a survey of UK PhD students who are working in any area of data science and I need your help!

The discovery of current mutational processes for predicting the tumor\u0026rsquo;s evolutionary trajectory requires dense sequencing of individual clones or single cells. Such studies, however, are inherently problematic because of the discovery of excessive false positive mutations when sequencing picogram quantities of DNA. Data pooling to increase the confidence in the discovered mutations, moves the discovery back in the past to a common ancestor. Here we report a robust whole genome sequencing and analysis pipeline (DigiPico/MutLX) that virtually eliminates all false positive results while retaining an excellent proportion of true positives. Using our method, we identified, for the first time, a hyper-mutation (kataegis) event in a group of ∼30 cancer cells from a recurrent ovarian carcinoma. This was unidentifiable from the bulk WGS data. Overall, we propose DigiPico/MutLX method as a powerful framework for the identification of clone-specific variants at an unprecedented accuracy.\nThe paper is published in eLife along with a commentary.\n","date":1590019200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1590019200,"objectID":"5638d63c20d46d882f1548de255d00c5","permalink":"https://cwcyau.github.io/post/2020-05-21_digipico/","publishdate":"2020-05-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020-05-21_digipico/","section":"post","summary":"Bulk whole genome sequencing (WGS) enables the analysis of tumor evolution but, because of depth limitations, can only identify old mutational events.

Data pooling to increase the confidence in the discovered mutations, moves the discovery back in the past to a common ancestor.","tags":["genomics","artificial intelligence"],"title":"New eLife publication: A highly accurate platform for clone-specific mutation discovery enables the study of active mutational processes","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":["genomics","artificial intelligence"],"content":"The PHG Foundation has published a report on Artificial intelligence for genomic medicine.

Birmingham) and Sylvia Richardson (MRC Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge).\nMultimorbidity Multimorbidity is when people suffer from more than one long-term illness. It is increasingly common as people live longer. It is important because individual illnesses have knock-on effects on others, it is more complex managing multiple than single illnesses, and multimorbid patients are heavy users of medications and health services.\nTo understand multimorbidity we need to know which illnesses tend to occur together and which illness combinations most affect health. To adapt health services we need to know which types of people develop multimorbidity: their age, sex, ethnicity, socio-economic status and whether they tend to live in the same households. To learn how to prevent it we need to identify lifestyle factors (physical activity, diet, smoking, alcohol) linked to multimorbidity and the measurements (laboratory test results, weight, blood pressure) that might be early signs.\nElectronic Health Records Electronic health records are a good source of information on multimorbidity because they include information on the same patient over many years. They include information on illnesses, medications, hospital admissions; measurements (laboratory tests, weight, blood pressure) and lifestyle (smoking, alcohol). Previous research has studied multimorbidity using a variety of statistical methods. It finds some illnesses, such as diabetes and heart disease tend to occur together. But different statistical methods often find different groups of illnesses. We need a single, consistent approach to this type of analysis to ensure we are researching the same groups of illnesses. Previous research generally has not made best use of all the available information. For example, patients are considered either to have or not have diabetes but research did not make use of laboratory measurements (such as blood glucose) identifying some people as likely to develop diabetes. Previous research grouped illnesses according to how commonly they occur together, without giving any special significance to combinations of illnesses linked to risk of death or hospital admission. Clearly such combinations of illness are of more importance. There are more advanced analysis methods which can address these and other shortcomings.\nThe Research The first part of our research will develop methods of data analysis. We will review research on different statistical methods for grouping illnesses together. We will hold a workshop involving leading UK researchers in the field to try to agree on the best approach to this type of analysis. Informed by this we will analyse two large databases of electronic health records, each including several million patients. In each database we will identify the groups of illnesses that co-occur and check our findings in the other database. This is considered good practice in analysis. At the end of this step we will produce software to analyse and find groups of illnesses in electronic health records and make this freely available for other researchers to use.\nThe next part of our research will use additional information from two large surveys. Both surveys include details not always available in health records e.g. occupation, diet, lifestyle and measures of frailty. One includes 500,000 people the other has information on the same people over a period of 14 years. We will describe the consequences for patients of different combinations of illnesses: their levels of frailty because it is linked to need for social care; development of further illnesses; medications, use of health services and death. We will work with patient advisors to help guide analysis of patients journeys through health services. We will investigate possible causes of multimorbidity including people\u0026rsquo;s social circumstances, the environment, lifestyle (smoking, alcohol, diet and exercise) and laboratory test results that might help indicate causes. This step will point to the areas of environment and lifestyle which should be investigated further as possible causes.\n","date":1569888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569888000,"objectID":"59ffd5e228e6a0fd7be83744d3963a97","permalink":"https://cwcyau.github.io/project/birmcam/","publishdate":"2019-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/birmcam/","section":"project","summary":"Bringing Innovative Research Methods to Clustering Analysis of Multimorbidity  (BIRM-CAM) project between the Universities of Birmingham and Cambridge funded by the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR).","tags":["Multimorbidity","Electronic Health Records","Digital Health"],"title":"BIRM-CAM","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":["health data","phd"],"content":"The Wellcome Trust have funded a new HDRUK-Turing Wellcome PhD programme in Health Data Science which will be jointly directed by Christopher Yau.

New and maturing technological developments hold the potential to have a transformative effect on health service delivery. Digital health solutions can aid in the reduction of waiting times, more effective use of limited resources and improved treatment fidelity but, once such technologies are implemented, the dearth of data that can be acquired through their adoption itself presents a challenge. Data-driven insights, driven by machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, can offer a glimpse of previously unknown patterns and identify opportunities for the development of new healthcare practices or policies. As digital health platforms become more sophisticated, the data that can be acquired often becomes more complex and heterogeneous, machine-based interpretation becomes a near-necessity.\nThe Breaking Free Group is a leading digital health and behaviour science company. Founded in 2010, it is formed from a team of psychologists, substance misuse experts and technology specialists. With an organisational philosophy built around the principles of state-of-the-art behaviour science and the UK Medical Research Council evaluation framework, they have developed a bespoke digital behavioural intervention platform that provides 24/7 access to a secure, GDPR-compliant, online digital cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) platform with a particular focus on substance misuse. Users of the platform complete pre- and post-therapy questionnaires and interactive exercises designed to teach strategies to overcome addictive behaviours and improve wellbeing. Scoring on questionnaire responses can signpost users to personalised information sources. Real-time quantitative data from the platform can be anonymously fed to health service providers and commissioners for planning and policy development purposes.\nBreaking Free has seen its digital platform commissioned for use by the Ministry of Justice in UK prisons, Non-Government Charitable Organisations and NHS Trusts. Uniquely, Breaking Free operates under a research ethics protocol approved by the NHS Health Research Authority and endorsement by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence allowing the data they collect to be utilised for broader research applications. More recently, two new online platforms have been deployed more widely to the public targeting alcohol consumption reduction and smoking cessation. Breaking Free are based in both Birmingham and Manchester.\nWe have initiated a new multi-disciplinary collaboration with the Breaking Free Online team to develop novel data science methodologies to exploit real-time digital health monitoring and intervention data. Our working exemplars will be based on the unique behavioural insights captured by the Breaking Free Group but the research outputs would have generic applicability in other related settings including youth mental health conditions.\n","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"903e3bd34bc5715642cc1c577de6e9e9","permalink":"https://cwcyau.github.io/project/breaking-free/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/breaking-free/","section":"project","summary":"The Data Science of Digital Behaviour Intervention","tags":["Mental Health","Digital Health","Behavioural Science"],"title":"Breaking Free with Artificial Intelligence","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Mutation signatures are the hallmarks of mutagenic processes in cancer that can provide clues about the biochemical mechanisms by which DNA is altered in cancer.

We show that our approach has state-of-the-art performance compared to standard methods but also generalizes to allow consideration of larger sequence contexts using deep layering of convolutional networks providing a tool that could potentially reveal the impact of high-level genome structure on mutational density.\nResearchers:\nYun Feng ","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"6ef4acfad03d239d3210cee5ba7049dc","permalink":"https://cwcyau.github.io/project/convsig/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/convsig/","section":"project","summary":"A novel convolutional filter-based approach for learning mutation signature representations.","tags":["Deep Learning","Explainable Algorithms","Machine Learning","Genomics","Cancer"],"title":"Convolutional filtering for mutation signatures","type":"project"},{"authors":["Kaspar Martens","Kieran Campbell","Christopher Yau"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"2e783807b92f86cf5d968282910b2831","permalink":"https://cwcyau.github.io/publication/2019-01-01_martens2019decomposing/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-01-01_martens2019decomposing/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Decomposing feature-level variation with covariate Gaussian process latent variable models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhiyuan Hu","Abdulkhaliq Alsaadi","Nina Wietek","Laura Santana Gonzalez","Christopher Yau","Ahmed Ashour Ahmed"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"0f6a4384eb385b71761fc3502ae3097a","permalink":"https://cwcyau.github.io/publication/2019-01-01_hu2019deep/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-01-01_hu2019deep/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Deep single-cell RNA-seq of the putative cell of origin revealed a novel molecular subtype of high-grade serous ovarian cancer with poor prognosis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alistair T Pagnamenta","Pierre Heemeryck","Hilary C Martin","Christophe Bosc","Leticia Peris","Ivy Uszynski","Sylvie Gory-Faure","Simon Couly","Charu Deshpande","Ata Siddiqui","{others}"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"c9f70a14bc5acea854f63907843ae731","permalink":"https://cwcyau.github.io/publication/2019-01-01_pagnamenta2019defective/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-01-01_pagnamenta2019defective/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Defective tubulin detyrosination causes structural brain abnormalities with cognitive deficiency in humans and mice","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The Health Data Research UK-Turing PhD programme in Health Data Science aims to develop future leaders in health data science.

A mechanistic understanding can be postulated based on time-course multi-omics genome-wide measurements.\nWe developed a novel Bayesian nonparametric regression approach called Multi-Omics NETwork inference (MONET) for high-dimensionality multi-modal data integration to quantify the temporally dependent forces driving development and investigate by perturbation effects. Sparsity-inducing priors regularise the TF-gene interaction network and a Dirichlet process prior to regulate the number of participating TFs. This gives rise to a Bayesian nonparametric model where the number of TFs are learnt from data and not specified a priori. Statistical inference is performed in a Bayesian setting using an implementation of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)-derived No-U Turn Sampler (NUTS) in STAN.\nWe show that MONET is able to extract accurate time-dependent TF-gene interaction networks and assess the importance of each TF for the different stages in haematopoietic development. Our model allows us to make predictions on the importance of specific TF over time and under different perturbation settings. Based on this we can create hypotheses for intervention to improve efficiency or halt development.\nResearchers:\nAnas Rana ","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"7a421e35041584216e7994b3a187fdbd","permalink":"https://cwcyau.github.io/project/monet/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/monet/","section":"project","summary":"A novel Bayesian nonparametric regression approach for high-dimensionality multi-modal data integration.","tags":["Machine Learning","Genomics"],"title":"Multi-Omics Network inference","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Neural network models for dimensionality reduction, such as Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs), can identify latent low-dimensional structures embedded within high-dimensional data.

However the latter requires interpreting what the decoder network has learnt which makes it challenging.\nIn this project, we have focused on understanding the sources of variation in Conditional VAEs. Our goal is to decompose the feature-level variation in high-dimensional data through disentanglement of additive and interactions effects of latent variables and fixed inputs. We propose to achieve this through the Neural Decomposition - an adaptation of the well-known concept of variance decomposition from classical statistics to deep learning models.

In collaboration with Ciccarelli Lab at the Francis Crick Institute we have developed a machine learning algorithm to identify cancer genes in individual patients considering all types of damaging alterations simultaneously. Analysing 261 EACs from the OCCAMS Consortium, we discover helper genes that, alongside well-known drivers, promote cancer. We confirm the robustness of our approach in 107 additional EACs. Unlike recurrent alterations of known drivers, these cancer helper genes are rare or patient-specific. However, they converge towards perturbations of well-known cancer processes. Recurrence of the same process perturbations, rather than individual genes, divides EACs into six clusters differing in their molecular and clinical features. Experimentally mimicking the alterations of predicted helper genes in cancer and pre-cancer cells validates their contribution to disease progression, while reverting their alterations reveals EAC acquired dependencies that can be exploited in therapy.\nResearchers:\nJoel Nulsen Hrvoje Misetic ","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"ecb501b2995eaf610b68803588dac95d","permalink":"https://cwcyau.github.io/project/cancer-drivers/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cancer-drivers/","section":"project","summary":"Identification of cancer-promoting genetic alterations using genome sequencing and machine learning.","tags":["Bioinformatics","Genomics","Cancer"],"title":"Precision medicine and individual-level cancer driver genes","type":"project"},{"authors":["{CONSORT-AI}","{SPIRIT-AI}"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"754aaf41370498975b59ec28120242e8","permalink":"https://cwcyau.github.io/publication/2019-01-01_consort2019reporting/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019-01-01_consort2019reporting/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Reporting guidelines for clinical trials evaluating artificial intelligence interventions are needed","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Genomic copy number evolution in cancer refers to the acquisition or loss of genome segments over time due to mutational processes in cancer that result in the loss of biological mechanisms for the maintenance of genome integrity in cells.

However, as our capability to generate experimental data improves, our ability to conceive of appropriate mathematical descriptions to describe biological phenomena has become a bottleneck.\nThe goal of machine learning is to “learn” complex dependencies automatically within data sets. Neural networks (NNs) have been at the forefront of recent advances by offering a means of parametrising complex functional mapping between data and its representations.\nNovel computational machinery have enabled NN approaches to scale to the analysis of unprecedently large datasets and provide versatility over standard modelling approaches. However, despite their successes in a range of applications, in biomedical research, NNs are often derided for their “black box” discoveries, lack of interpretability and the need for unrealistic quantities of training data. Such criticisms often overlook the fact that default NN structures express no explicit assumptions about the problems on which they are applied and they are often used as generic data mining devices for discovery purposes.\nNonetheless, there is a clear opportunity for the development of novel NN approaches that combine scalability and versatility with the capability of learning the physically realistic constraints that are embedded in hand-crafted mathematical models.\nThis project seeks to investigate the methodological foundations for what could form an Automated BioData Scientist (AutoBioDataSci) platform. We would like to develop learning algorithms that can capture biological laws and encapsulate them in such a way that such knowledge can be transfer to new problems. This major project involves inter-linking representation learning theory with transfer and meta-learning as well as having its roots embedded in the biological scientific discovery

This was also a common feature in women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations prior to ovarian cancer initiation. Thus, our data has important implications for screening, although it will need additional clinical evaluation to test the feasibility of quantitative detection of SOX2 expression or the expression of its downstream targets for this purpose. You can read the original research paper here as well as media reports here and here.\nThe unmasking non-genetic heterogeneity through by single-cell sequencing of fallopian tube epithelial cells More recently, we have used single cell sequencing to understand the inter-differentiation between cell states which promotes cancer cell survival under stress and fosters non-genetic heterogeneity (NGH). NGH is a surrogate of tumor resilience but its quantification is confounded by genetic heterogeneity. We showed that NGH can be accurately measured when informed by the molecular signatures of the normal cells of origin. We surveyed the transcriptomes of 4000 normal fallopian tube epithelial (FTE) cells, the cells of origin of serous ovarian cancer, and identified six FTE subtypes. We used subtype signatures to deconvolute SOC expression data and found substantial intra-tumor NGH that was previously unrecognized. Importantly, NGH-based stratification of ∼1700 tumors robustly predicted survival. Our findings lay the foundation for accurate prognostic and therapeutic stratification of SOC.

for cancer\nTrack Record [max 2 pages] I am an Artificial Intelligence (AI) researcher with a focus on developing computational and statistical methodologies for problems within the biomedical and health sciences.\nResearch Contributions. In Statistics and Machine Learning, my major contributions have included i) expanding the statistical toolkit for Markov models, ii) Bayesian nonparametric latent variable modelling for high-dimensional data and iii) novel methodology for bioinformatics. A significant feature of my work is the synthesis of statistical and machine learning principles. I routinely published in both the major machine learning conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, AISTATS) [@aueb2014hamming; @law2017testing; @rukat2017bayesian; @rukat2018probabilistic; @martens2019decomposing; @martens2019ens; @martens2020nd; @martens2020trans] as well as the most prominent statistical journals (JASA, JRSSB) [@yau2011bayesian; @titsias2016statistical; @titsias2017hamming] cross-fertilising ideas from both domains. These accomplishments have been made while my primary role has been as a Principal Investigator within medical faculties with responsibilities for a genomic medicine research programme that studies human disease - in particular, cancer. This has involved supervision of experimental scientists, experimental design as well as direct funding of these efforts. I have therefore developed an array of integrated collaborations with biological and clinical research groups within which my team has been embedded to carry out this work.\nAcademic Citizenship. For the last five years, I have focused on my young family which has limited my availability for international travel and collaborations. During this period I have focused on supporting early career researchers in my group and to maximise my national identity through participation in a number of UK initiatives. This platform gives me a strong basis to utilise this Fellowship to accelerate my progress to an international leader in AI.\nGenomics England. I founded and co-lead the Quantitative Methods, Machine Learning and Functional Genomics Clinical Interpretation Partnership (GeCIP) for the Genomics England (GEL) 100,000 Genomes Project (100KGP) with Professor Martin Tobin (Leicester). This involves coordinating and reviewing 100KGP research activities across a national network of researchers on behalf of GEL as well as membership of the scientific steering committee giving me deep insight into the developing genomic medicine landscape in England. My work also involves advocacy for genomic medicine, for example, I have recently contributed to the PHG Foundation report on \u0026quot;Artificial intelligence for genomic medicine\u0026quot; as well as organising an upcoming workshop on Machine Learning and AI with GSK (due to held in July 2020).\nHealth Data Research UK/Alan Turing Institute. In 2019, I co-led (with Professor Peter Diggle) a successful application on behalf of the Health Data Research UK (HDRUK) and The Alan Turing Institute (Turing) for a Wellcome PhD Programme in Health Data Science. This is a unique multi-institutional PhD programme1 that is founded on HDRUK\u0026rsquo;s One Institute vision of collective and collaborative working in health data science. I am work package co-lead for artificial intelligence and multimodal data integration in the HDRUK Multi-omics Consortium with Dr Michael Inouye (Cambridge). I am also Principal Investigator of a Turing Health Programme project, funded by a Strategic Priorities Fund AI for Science and Government award, which provides matched support for the work.\nFLIER. I am a member of the Taskforce, consisting of senior academic, government, NHS and industry representatives, that developed the Academy of Medical Sciences (AMS) Future Leaders in Enterprise and Research (FLIER) Leadership Programme. Here, I was able to utilise my analytical and influencing skills to shape the format of the programme, challenging our senior leaders to improve their understanding of the needs of those in middle career stages and to boost the inclusivity and diversity ambitions of this programme, in particular, by advocating the needs of women in science.\nOther Activities. I am a member of the steering group for the international CONSORT/SPIRIT-AI consortium where we are developing new guidelines for the evaluation of AI-driven health interventions in randomised control trials [@liu2019reporting]. I am applying knowledge from this initiative as part of my contribution to the Phase 4 review panel for the AI in Health and Care Award run by the AAC in partnership with NHSX and NIHR. I also sit on the MRC Methodology Research Panel where I have contributed to the development of MRC\u0026rsquo;s data science strategy for its next funding cycle.\nResearcher Development. I have been fortunate to have trained and mentored a fantastic group of students and postdoctoral fellows in the last 8 years. Many have gone on to substantially AI and/or Data Science related careers including in industry (2), independent research fellows (4) or with academic faculty-level appointments (2). I am a strong believer in developing early independence opportunities for my research team. I also sit on the Turing Institute Research Training and Development Panel and and Advisory Group and act as a regular Academic Mentor for Doctoral Students.\nResearch environment. I was recently appointed as Chair in Artificial Intelligence in Manchester as part of a university initiative to substantially increase AI capability. This growth plan has also seen the parallel recruitment of Professor Samuel Kaski, who has joined Manchester as part of a joint professorship with Aalto University. Prof Kaski is Director of the Artificial Intelligence Center of Finland which hosts a European Laboratory for Learning and Intelligent Systems (ELLIS) unit. Together with Professor Magnus Rattray (academic mentor, see Institutional Support Letter), Director of the Manchester Institute for Data Science and AI and ELLIS Health Programme Fellow, we have ambitious plans to make Manchester one of the most exciting UK hubs for AI activity, particularly in Health. For example, the Christabel Pankhurst Institute for Health Technology, is a new £25M investment between the University and regional partners to provide a technology translation and development hub for digital health which will be led by Prof Kaski.\nIn cancer, the Manchester Cancer Research Centre (MCRC) (its Director Professor Rob Bristow will be an academic mentor for my fellowship, see Institutional Support Letter) is a joint initiative between The University of Manchester, Cancer Research UK and The Christie NHS Foundation Trust. It has since been established as the cancer research arm of the Manchester Academic Health Science Centre (MAHSC), which is a strategic partnership between the University and six NHS Trusts across Greater Manchester. The Cancer Research UK Manchester Institute (one of only two \u0026ldquo;major\u0026quot; CRUK centres) and The Christie Hospital, the largest single site cancer centre in Europe and the first UK centre to be accredited as a comprehensive cancer centre treating more than 44,000 patients a year, are at the heart of the MCRC. The Paterson Redevelopment Project will lead to the construction of a new world-leading cancer research institute by 2030. Manchester is also part of the CRUK International Alliance for Cancer Early Detection (ACED). There are few locations in the UK with this combination of AI ambition and core strengths in cancer and despite the immense challenges posed by covid-19 for the university sector, the University of Manchester has reaffirmed their institutional support for this fellowship proposal (1x 3yr Postdoc, 1x PhD, 0.5x RSE).\nProposed Research and Context Background 17pt\n[\u0026ldquo;In the spring of 2012, I received the devastating diagnosis of ovarian cancer - the \u0026lsquo;silent killer\u0026rsquo; Why me? Why anyone? Like thousands of women before me, I searched for reasons WHY whilst trying to come to terms with the illness.\u0026rdquo;]{.roman} \u0026mdash; Patient 11152\n\\vspace{4pt} \\vspace{0.2cm} Ovarian Cancer. Ovarian cancer (OvCa) affects approximately 7,000 women per year in the UK, with half over the age of 65. OvCa is hard to detect, often presenting at an advanced stage making it extremely difficult to treat. There has been little progress with improving mortality rates in the last 20 years with 5-year survival rates as low as 10-15% for the most common high-grade serous subtype (HGSOC). In order to unlock the disease, international efforts have focused on understanding the molecular determinants of the condition through new technologies including -omics [@bowtell2010genesis].\nMy contributions have included being amongst the first to use multi-region whole genome sequencing (WGS) to extensively characterise the genetic heterogeneity within a single OvCa patient (Patient 11152) and showing that an individual can harbour both chemotherapy-sensitive and resistant cell populations (Figure [fig:patient_11152]{reference-type=\u0026ldquo;ref\u0026rdquo; reference=\u0026ldquo;fig:patient_11152\u0026rdquo;}(a)). We also identified an early premalignant mutation in the SOX2 gene, which was found to be frequently overexpressed in the fallopian tubes (FT) of OvCa patients [@hellner2016premalignant]. We have used single cell RNA sequencing to survey the cellular FT landscape of OvCa and showed that gene expression patterns in the tumours can be traced back to those of certain FT cell types [@hu2020repertoire]. This has allowed us to postulate that OvCa\u0026rsquo;s can derive from different cell types within the FT and that the cell-of-origin can drive significant differences in survival outcomes. More recently, we have developed novel sequencing technologies to examine minimal residual disease (MRD) tumor samples that persist after initial first-round treatments and repopulate the disease leading to recurrence [@karaminejadranjbar2020highly]. This led us to characterise genomic alterations, specific to one metastatic tumour sample from Patient 11152 that had previously been uncharacterised by standard sequencing. This provided evidence of the ongoing disease evolution of the disease within the patient.\n\\centering {width=\u0026ldquo;85%\u0026rdquo;}\n[[fig:patient_11152]]{#fig:patient_11152 label=\u0026ldquo;fig:patient_11152\u0026rdquo;}\nVision. Throughout this work, I have been struck by the many layers of molecular complexity underlying OvCa that have been revealed by advanced \u0026lsquo;omics technologies (multi-omics). Complexity that we have begun to painstakingly unravel and enable clinicians and patients, like 11185, to better understand why their disease happened and how it could be treated (Figure [fig:patient_11152]{reference-type=\u0026ldquo;ref\u0026rdquo; reference=\u0026ldquo;fig:patient_11152\u0026rdquo;}(b)). If this could be routinely undertaken, not just for one patient, but every patient, we would begin to realise the ambitions of cancer precision medicine: to treat patients at the right time in the right way. In this fellowship proposal, I aim to investigate the fundamental AI technologies that would enable the realisation of this ambition.\nObjectives \u0026ldquo;An understanding of the dynamics of cancer evolution might lead to improvement in clinical outcomes, as it enables prognoses to be accurately determined and \u0026rsquo;evolution-aware\u0026rsquo; patient management to be applied.\u0026quot; \u0026mdash; Turajlic et. al. (2019), Nature Reviews Genetics.\n\\vspace{0.5cm} Overview. Central to the realisation of this vision is the need for a model of molecular cancer progression. With a research team assembled through this fellowship, given patient data, we would like to be able to reconstruct the series of molecular events that have led to their current state of disease and to use this model to predict the future course of their disease under different treatment regimes (Figure [fig:overview]{reference-type=\u0026ldquo;ref\u0026rdquo; reference=\u0026ldquo;fig:overview\u0026rdquo;}). My intention is not to study cancer evolution in itself but to leverage the extensive pool of existing knowledge derived over the last decade of cancer \u0026lsquo;omics research to build computable models that could enable us to apply this knowledge in a clinical setting [@swanton2020take]. I will centre my thinking around ovarian cancer but the methodologies will be applicable to all cancers and potentially other diseases that will be explored with a broad body of project partners that I have assembled for this proposal.\n\\centering {#fig:overview width=\u0026ldquo;60%\u0026rdquo;}\nExisting work. Longitudinal sampling represents the gold standard for acquiring data to measure disease progression through repeated sampling over time. However, in cancer this is rarely possible since patients typically only present for diagnosis once signs and symptoms of the disease have occurred and subsequent treatments will immediately perturb the disease therefore preventing direct observation of the natural evolution of the disease. We have overcome this limitation by constructing models that exploit the asynchronous properties of cancer patients within cross-sectional cohorts to recover pseudotemporal information about the dynamics of cancer evolution [@campbell2018uncovering].\n\\centering {#fig:pst width=\u0026ldquo;90%\u0026rdquo;}\nLatent Variable Models. In terms of modelling, given a collection of high-dimensional observation vectors ${ {\\bf y}_1, \\dots, {\\bf y}_N }$ for $N$ individuals (Figure [fig:pst]{reference-type=\u0026ldquo;ref\u0026rdquo; reference=\u0026ldquo;fig:pst\u0026rdquo;}(a)), we assume that the data are noisy observations that sit on embedded non-linear manifolds within the high-dimensional observational space. These manifolds each correspond to a different disease trajectory and distance along a manifold relates to the degree of molecular progression (Figure [fig:pst]{reference-type=\u0026ldquo;ref\u0026rdquo; reference=\u0026ldquo;fig:pst\u0026rdquo;}(b)). This can be captured by a hierarchical latent variable model: $$\\begin{aligned} {\\bf y}_n \u0026amp;= {\\bf x}_n + {\\bm \\epsilon}_n, ~ n=1,\\dots,N, \\ {\\bf x}_n \u0026amp;= {\\bf f}({\\bf z}_n(\\tau_n), {\\bf c}_n),\\end{aligned}$$ where ${\\bf x}_n$ corresponds to the noise-free observation, ${\\bf z}_n$ are the coordinates in a low-dimensional latent space which is mapped to the high-dimensional observation space via ${\\bf f}$ and $\\tau_n$ is a unidimensional latent quantity denoting a notion of \u0026ldquo;distance\u0026quot; along the manifold which we utilise as a measure of disease progression. Our work has shown that such measures highlight molecular heterogeneity amongst cancer patients that would be considered to be identical under standard clinicopathlogical variables (Figure [fig:existing]{reference-type=\u0026ldquo;ref\u0026rdquo; reference=\u0026ldquo;fig:existing\u0026rdquo;}(c)) Additional covariates of relevance are captured by ${\\bf c}_n$.\nDecomposable nonlinear dimensionality reduction. In statistical machine learning, where ${\\bf f}$ is treated as an unknown function, popular models include the Gaussian Process [@lawrence2004gaussian] or deep neural networks particularly in the form of Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) [@kingma2014stochastic]. We have recently extended both frameworks [@martens2019decomposing; @martens2020nd] to include explicit additive structures on the mappings: $$\\begin{aligned} x_{pn} = f_{c}^p({\\bf c}n) + f{z}^p({\\bf z}n(\\tau_n)) + f{cz}^p({\\bf z}_n(\\tau_n), {\\bf c}_n), ~ p=1,\\dots,P,\\end{aligned}$$ which allow us to more precisely define the relationships between each feature, the latent quantities and the covariates providing interpretable structure which means ${\\bf f}$ is not simply a black-box (Figure [fig:pst]{reference-type=\u0026ldquo;ref\u0026rdquo; reference=\u0026ldquo;fig:pst\u0026rdquo;}(c)). This feature-level interpretability means we can understand the model in terms of how original features vary along trajectories allowing experimental validation and the possibility of biomarker tests to be developed to measure and confirm patient disease progression (Figure [fig:existing]{reference-type=\u0026ldquo;ref\u0026rdquo; reference=\u0026ldquo;fig:existing\u0026rdquo;}(a)). We have also extended these models to incorporate scale- and translation-invariance allowing us to group features exhibiting similar functional behaviour [@martens2020trans] (Figure [fig:existing]{reference-type=\u0026ldquo;ref\u0026rdquo; reference=\u0026ldquo;fig:existing\u0026rdquo;}(b)). This enables the identification of \u0026ldquo;pathways\u0026quot; or coordinated biological behaviour across many different genes or proteins. These constraints have the benefit of promoting adherence to biological reality whilst vastly reducing the feasible model space meaning it is possible to learn effectively from the relatively small data sets common in cancer studies such as the OXO-PCR clinical trial (Figure [fig:existing]{reference-type=\u0026ldquo;ref\u0026rdquo; reference=\u0026ldquo;fig:existing\u0026rdquo;}(c)).2\n\\centering {#fig:existing width=\u0026ldquo;85%\u0026rdquo;}\nWork Packages. Building upon this existing work, I propose two AI-focused work packages to undertake detailed and novel research into models to account for (i) treatment intervention and (ii) genetic evolution. I then outline a decision making process in the third work package to determine the specific clinical applications that we will build using these technologies leveraging the interest and in-kind contributions (total value: \u0026gt; £8M) of the large body of project partners assembled in support. Note, for conciseness, I will not specifically describe challenges related to the use of specific data modalities (e.g. bulk vs single cell data). I believe my track record provides evidence of my capability to address these issues.\n\\vspace{0.25cm} {\\it WP1: Mechanistically-driven latent variable models of treatment interventions [Years 1-3]} . Our existing methodology has been beneficial for modelling the \u0026ldquo;natural evolution\u0026quot; of untreated cancers but are not directly amenable to data collected from post-treatment samples where the treatment may have perturbed the progression of the disease (Figure [fig:treatment]{reference-type=\u0026ldquo;ref\u0026rdquo; reference=\u0026ldquo;fig:treatment\u0026rdquo;}(a)). Our goal is to construct models to allow quantification of interventional effects at the molecular level. However, the a priori knowledge of the absolute molecular effects of the intervention is often poorly characterised and may only be defined in qualitative terms, i.e. a drug acts to down-regulate the expression of a particular pathway. This type of knowledge could be expressed in terms of derivatives motivating a mechanistic approach: $$\\begin{aligned} x_{pn}(\\tau_n) \u0026amp;= \\int_{-\\infty}^{\\tau_n} g^p({\\bf x}_n(t), {\\bf z}_n(t), t) d t, ~ p=1,\\dots,P,\\end{aligned}$$ where each observed feature is governed by a system of ordinary (or potentially stochastic) differential equations (ODEs) $g$ whose integration limits depend on an unobserved molecular time $\\tau_n$. I am therefore seeking to develop a novel class of mechanistically-driven dimensionality reduction methods (Figure [fig:treatment]{reference-type=\u0026ldquo;ref\u0026rdquo; reference=\u0026ldquo;fig:treatment\u0026rdquo;}(c)) where we wish to identify a low-dimensional latent embedding for the data where the mapping from the latent to observable space is governed by a dynamic model whose form is not necessarily known but can be parameterised through deep neural networks [@chen2018neural].\n\\centering {#fig:treatment width=\u0026ldquo;85%\u0026rdquo;}\nWe will initially focus on ODEs that take the form: $$\\begin{aligned} \\frac{ \\partial x_p }{ \\partial \\tau } \u0026amp;= g_p^p(x_p(\\tau), {\\bf z}(\\tau)) + \\sum_{q \\neq p} g_q^p(x_q(\\tau), {\\bf z}(\\tau)) + \\sum_{q} g_{pq}^p(x_p(\\tau), x_q(\\tau), {\\bf z}(\\tau)) + \\underbrace{I_p(x_p(\\tau), z(\\tau))}_{\\mbox{\\scriptsize Treatment}},\\end{aligned}$$ which relates the time-evolution of each feature to itself, influences from other features, feature-feature interactions and finally an intervention term to account for treatment effects. The latter is of interest since current cancer treatments are administered ignorant of high-resolution molecular factors and therefore characterising the molecular effects of current treatments is of interest. This setup will allow the proposed work to build upon and integrate with hybrid mechanistic-machine learning models for characterising drug perturbations on cancer cell lines that have established network models of molecular interactions. These can be used as prior information to regularise our models [@oates2014causal; @korkut2015perturbation; @stewart2017integrating; @frohlich2018efficient; @yuan2019interpretable]. Note that these previous efforts are framed in a tightly regulated setting under highly controlled experimental conditions. Our objective is to address patient disease evolution and heterogeneity which are factors not covered by previous studies.\nThis work will also integrate causal approaches to establish connections beween our mechanistic with structural causal models to model the behaviour of systems under interventions [@mooij2013ordinary; @pfister2019learning; @peters2020causal]. We will develop novel variants these concepts specific to understanding causal relations in the presence of uncertainty in the molecular effects of interventions. We will work with academic partners (see Data and Experimental support) to experimentally validate computational predictions.\n\\vspace{0.25cm} {\\it WP2: Reinforcement learning cancer evolution [Years 1-3]} . Genome instability is a hallmark of many cancers, including OvCa, which is said to be \u0026ldquo;copy number driven\u0026quot; [@macintyre2018copy; @berger2018comprehensive; @the2020pan]. Loss of genomic integrity in cancer cells leads to the accumulation of chromosomal abnormalities - segments of DNA which are lost or duplicated (Figure [fig:rl]{reference-type=\u0026ldquo;ref\u0026rdquo; reference=\u0026ldquo;fig:rl\u0026rdquo;}(a)). Remarkably, whilst copy number evolution has been extensively studied [@de2014spatial; @wang2014clonal; @gao2016punctuated] and genomic instability is strongly linked to cancer outcomes [@hieronymus2018tumor], there are currently no generative probabilistic models that describe this phenomenon. Closely related work includes the identification of tumour-specific phylogenies [@caravagna2018detecting; @satas2020scarlet] or the use of Gillespie simulations [@mcfarland2014tug; @lopez2020interplay] but these approaches do not elucidate the low-dimensional representations we require to encapsulate complex evolution processes that might give rise to a so-called evo/eco-index [@maley2017classifying].\nThe modelling challenge lies in the fact that each copy number alteration event that be described by a triplet of information: start position, end position, alteration type. It is not a simple vectorisable data type. Successive copy number alterations can overlap leading to a different type of model requirement compared to that described in WP1 which is more suited to (near)continuous data types (gene expression, proteins, metabolomics) rather than discrete DNA sequence data which requires its own \u0026ldquo;arithmetic\u0026quot;.\nRecently, my group has begun to develop novel deep reinforcement learning (Deep RL) approaches for learning probabilistic models of genomic evolution [@feng2020]. The principle is that we can capture evolutionary pressures through a policy governing the Markov transitions between genomic states (Figure [fig:rl]{reference-type=\u0026ldquo;ref\u0026rdquo; reference=\u0026ldquo;fig:rl\u0026rdquo;}(b)). Evolution is treated as an agent which takes actions against the genome causing it to mutate. The genome returns rewards which are related to the compatibility of that action with real world tumour copy number profiles. Using RL we learn policies that allow us to generate evolutionary event sequences which can give rise to biologically realistic genomic copy number profiles (Figure [fig:rl]{reference-type=\u0026ldquo;ref\u0026rdquo; reference=\u0026ldquo;fig:rl\u0026rdquo;}(c)). These trained models can then be used to retrospective infer evolutionary histories given a tumour profile or to forward project the evolution of the genome for predictive purposes. Importantly, in order for such a model to be tractable, we need to incorporate prior knowledge of actual biological mechanisms and constraints. Here, for example, we require the notion of positivity (copy numbers cannot be negative), whole genome duplications (WGD) [@lopez2020interplay; @cross2020evolutionary] are a special action that cause genomic content to double, invariant to arbitrary permutations of the chromosome labelling, etc. Interestingly, to overcome the limited number of real tumour profiles available (e.g. 300 from the TCGA OvCa dataset), we have adopted notions of self-play made prominent by recent high-profile applications, such as AlphaGo, to train our models [@silver2017mastering].\n\\centering {#fig:rl width=\u0026ldquo;90%\u0026rdquo;}\nThe goal of this work package is to further develop a reinforcement learning approach for genomic evolution that has the scope and scalability for later clinical applications. Since the number of possible mutation types and the genome is enormous, we will investigate scalable approaches to allow whole genome analysis with high-resolution (our current implementation is only operable at coarse resolutions of a 1-5 megabases). This will include, for instance, investigating the use of deep representation approaches for describing large action and state spaces [@chandak2019learning] that can be used to derive analogous evolutionary progression time measures (to $\\tau$ in WP1). We will also explore novel variations on ideas such as action elimination [@zahavy2018learn] or attention mechanisms to hone in on copy number hotspots to reduce computational burden [@vaswani2017attention]. Further, in order to capture evolutionary divergence, we will extend the approach to allow tree-structured mixtures of policies to model tumour heterogeneity, integrating with the extesive pre-existing work in this area, within a framework that integrates other mutation types, notably point mutations (single nucleotide variants, SNVs), giving rise to an ambitious attempt to jointly model dual aspects of the evolving cancer genome.\n\\vspace{0.25cm} {\\it WP3: Developing clinical applications [Years 4-5]} . This work package will be broken down into distinct phases consisting of an initial scoping exercise followed by three cycles of development (see Work Plan). During the scoping exercise, the capabilities offered by the outputs of WP1 and WP2 will be introduced to the potential user groups (clinician, patients, pharma) via a series of engagement events. We will then identify a small number of realisable exemplar applications that - in consultation with the Steering Group (see Impact) - will be developed during the remaining project period. This work maybe carried out wholly by my research team or in collaboration with the project partners leveraging in-kind support. Each development phase will involve an agreed set of objectives that are intended to be realised over a 3-6 month period. Each phase will end with an evaluation period where next steps are agreed. A final series of prototype evaluations will occur at the end of the Fellowship period. This approach is specifically designed to leverage the opportunity afforded by this fellowship scheme\u0026rsquo;s for flexible resource utilisation in Years 3-5 and utilises the project partners to help define the most impactful applications of our technologies and actively engage in steering the project in Years 4-5.\nThere are however two possible applications that I can anticipate. First, a clinical decision support (CDS) system to support clinicians involved in Molecular Tumour Boards (MTBs) in the interpretation of complex \u0026lsquo;omics. This would be in supported within my own institution via the digital Experimental Cancer Medicine Team3 who have an ongoing programme of constructing decision support systems to facilitate local MTB activities. We would leverage this existing infrastructure to facilitate fast-track the movement of our research to clinical applicability. Second, working with pharmaceutical partners, we could integrate our methods into advanced clinical trial designs that combine \u0026lsquo;omics profiling and AI-based progression modelling to account for treatment and outcome heterogeneity effects. This would be an advance on current genomics-based cancer clinical trials which are typically based on targeted gene panels or genomic regions and lack the resolution to account for molecular heterogeneity within and between patients.\nData and Experimental support. This work will be conducted in collaboration with a number of clinical/academic labs (see Letters of Support). All laboratories have offered substantial in-kind support in access to pre- and post-treatment molecular data sets from model systems (cell lines, organoids, mice) and human patients using a range of technologies (e.g WGS, RNAseq, IMC, methylation, nanopore, single-cell). In addition, bioinformatics support and laboratory technician time have been included to generate novel data sets where investigations require additional data or novel biological insights have been uncovered.\nNational Importance The importance of this proposed work is underlined by the NHS Long Term Plan which states that \u0026ldquo;linking and correlating genomics, clinical data and data from patients provides routes to new treatments, diagnostic patterns and information to help patients make informed decisions about their care.\u0026quot; [@england2019nhs; @health2019topol] Toward this, national initiatives such as the GEL 100KGP, the NHS Genomic Laboratory Hubs and the ISCF Accelerating Detection of Disease project are now beginning to embed physical infrastructure within the health service to provide routine -omics analysis capability. Within 10-15 years, we will expect to see a revolution in the way in which the molecular characterisation of disease, particularly cancer, will impact on routine clinical practice with a matching requirement for intelligent analytics to support its implementation. Further, there are a large number of clinical cancer multi-omics initiatives occurring internationally (e.g. The Tumor Profiler Study [@irmisch2020tumor]) so the UK is not alone in this endeavour. Given this background, I believe this is the right time to shape the analytical frameworks that will accompany the molecular technologies to make use of the emerging data from this modernisation. My combination of interests, expertise and integration into some of the aforementioned initiatives therefore presents an opportunity to become world leader in AI for clinical \u0026lsquo;omics.\nImpact [max 2 pages] This research aims to advance a body of core AI technologies for clinical applications of multi-omics for cancer progression modelling. In order to maximise the impact of such developments, I have assembled a body of charity (OCA), academic (Birmingham, Oxford, Kings/Crick, Karolinska, UC Davis) and industry-based project partners (Roche, Astra Zeneca, NEC Labs, Hummingbird Diagnostics) that will support the translation of these ideas. The commitment of the partners is evidenced by over £8M of specified in-kind contributions to the proposed project. I will maintain relationships with project partners via three main mechanisms:\n(i) Stakeholder Events. I will host annual stakeholder engagement meetings involving all project partners to review the progression of the fellowship. Each meeting will be themed to focus on specific areas of focus (Patient Engagement, Artificial Intelligence, Pharmaceuticals, Clinicians and Patients) and timed to match project milestones. External participants will be invited ensuring a broad representation of stakeholders beyond those directly supporting this application.\n(ii) Secondments and Exchanges. I have incorporated up to six months of potential secondment/exchange time for members of the my research team to participate in visits to project partners. These opportunities will provide career enhancement experiences for the researchers themselves, whilst at the same time providing a more intimate opportunity to exchange and share ideas and progress.\n(iii) Co-design and Steering Group. A steering group will be assembled from patient and project partner representatives. They will oversee the main project start, mid-term and completion reviews. The group will provide guidance and advice to myself and the project team about the development of the project particularly with the areas of impact to focus in toward the latter stages of the project (WP3). The Steering Group chairs will be Institutional mentors, Professors Rattray and Bristow.\nIn addition to impacts on clinical applications of cancer modelling as outlined in the Work Packages, there are further specific areas of wider engagement that I will develop:\nPatient and public engagement. With Ovarian Cancer Action, I will engage with patient stakeholders to raise awareness of the importance of AI in the interpretation of complex \u0026lsquo;omics data and its role within an emerging new paradigm for how cancer is diagnosed and treated. I will also work with OCA to engage patient groups to understand the patient perspective of our work. Does the ability to provide vastly more detailed information about an individual\u0026rsquo;s disease lead to mental overload? Does it help to remove the mystique about a diagnosis? How can we better support clinician-patient interactions? This will underlie one of the themed stakeholder events described above and leverage my pre-existing work with OCA and the Oxford Ovarian Cancer Lab.\nEarly Detection. The generative models that we will develop will simplify the process of \u0026ldquo;rolling back\u0026quot; to an earlier point in the tumour development enabling putative early molecular changes to be identified. This is of particular interest in Manchester which is part of the CRUK-supported £55M International Alliance for Cancer Early Detection (ACED).4 All research conducted during this fellowship will seek to align and exploit further funding opportunities and partnerships within ACED. Further, I have also engaged with industry partner Hummingbird Diagnostics, who are developing liquid biopsy diagnostics for early disease detection based on highly disease-specific miRNA biomarkers. This partnership has the potential to see our AI technologies supporting the actual development of novel biomarker tests.\nOther Data Modalities. Two areas that this proposal has not addressed are imaging and real-world evidence (RWE) using large-scale clinical cancer data sets. Recent examples have highlighted the importance of novel AI in these areas. [@alaa2018autoprognosis; @shen2020learning; @bica2020real; @abduljabbar2020geospatial]. As a member of the Strategy Advisory Group for the Health Programme at The Alan Turing Institute, I am currently advising on a potential strategic partnership between the Turing and a global pharmaceutical company. This partnership would provide opportunities for research collaboration, access to domain expertise and valuable sources of RWE data linking -omics to clinical trials. If this application is successful, I would use the fellowship to engage with this partnership, if and when Turing successfully concludes negotiations5. Further, in medical imaging, I have engaged with the EU ERA \u0026ldquo;Advancing Breast Cancer histopathology towards AI-based Personalised medicine\u0026quot; consortium (ABCAP), led by the Karolinska Institutet (see Support Letter), who are developing AI methodology for automating screening of routine histopathology images. In collaboration we would co-develop joint models for molecular and image-based disease progression characterisation.\nEquality, diversity and inclusion Career development. The project has been designed to ensure all researchers have equal opportunity to take leadership over work components as well as training to further their career potential. Each work package has been designed to be led by each of the three PDRAs (see Work Plan). Thesis projects for PhD students would be shaped to work across work packages giving students the opportunity to develop a unique synthesis of ideas whilst allowing PDRAs the opportunity to share in mentorship and supervisory responsibilities. All PDRAs and students will have the opportunity to have up to six months experience outside of the main project to develop collaborations with external stakeholders. Organisation of themed stakeholder events will be led by the research team members.\nOvarian Cancer and Gender. For OvCa, it is evident that for a disease which, predominantly impacts women only, a female voice should be integral to every aspect of its delivery.6 Working with Ovarian Cancer Action and our institutional Athena Swan team, we will work to actively promote the research opportunities to female researchers (noting that they are under-represented in AI as well). Every team member will receive training from the charity to ensure they develop a deep understanding of the disease and its wider impacts. These individuals would develop as an Ambassador for the project and be central to our dissemination plans both internally and externally.\nIntegration with external activities. As co-Director of the HDRUK-Turing PhD Programme, I am actively involved in developing innovative approaches to improving research culture including EDI. This is required by Wellcome for the award of the programme but also couples with the missions of the two national institutes. I will endeavour to leverage the broader scale of EDI activities associated with this programme within my fellowship to obtain the critical mass needed to inspire real change.\nResponsible research and innovation. Genomic medicine is motivated by the understanding that human disease is driven by molecular factors, including genetics, and treatments should be adapted to these features which may differ from patient to patient. Stratification by molecular features can lead to differential treatment strategies that could incidentally correlate with sub-groups of the human population including sub-group designations which associate with sex or ethnicity. There is increasing evidence that the molecular traits of cancer are related to ancestry [@li2020genomic]. Sensitivity and an understanding of the wider implications of these issues must be at the heart of all work in this area and the development of artificial intelligence techniques is no exception. Towards this goal, I have initiated a specific collaboration with Professor Carvajal-Carmona at the UC Davis Comprehensive Cancer Centre (see Support Letter) who have an extensive track record of work in genetics and cancer research in ethnic minorities groups and other causes of disparity in California and Latin America. Recently, they have been supported by NIH to establish patient-derived animal and cellular cancer models for \u0026lsquo;omics profiling specifically from ethnic minority groups. There are no such equivalent projects in the UK and therefore this exemplar stands out as an opportunity for my team and partners to learn best practice and considerations for responsible engagement across communities.\nImpact of covid-19 Due to the impact of covid-19 on the UK health system and economy, I have understandably not attempted to obtain direct support from NHS organisations at this challenging time. In addition, OCA are unable to commit financial support for this research at this time as had been previously discussed during the outline stage. If the fellowship is awarded, I will re-engage with discussions at a later date. Finally, over the last 10 weeks, I have spent the majority of my time providing home schooling and childcare for my daughter with only limited time available for this application alongside regular academic responsibilities. I am not alone in facing these challenges but wish to voice the impact on covid-19 on productivity on all applicants with care responsibilities during these challenging and unprecedented times.\n2\n\\printbibliography 0.75\n\\endgroup\nConsisting of Queen\u0026rsquo;s Belfast, Birmingham, Cambridge, Edinburgh, Manchester, Oxford and University College London\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nURL: https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-cancer/find-a-clinical-trial/a-study-help-doctors-predict-who-will-respond-well-paclitaxel-chemotherapy-cancer-ovary-oxo-pcr-01\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nURL: https://digitalecmt.org/\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nACED: https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/funding-for-researchers/research-opportunities-in-early-detection-and-diagnosis/international-alliance-for-cancer-early-detection\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nAnticipated agreement date: Q4 2020\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nMen can carry heritable genetic mutations that lead to increased risk of ovarian cancer.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"05e37344abde1502b5f6f978ae0d3ab5","permalink":"https://cwcyau.github.io/post/2020-06-20_case-for-support-final/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2020-06-20_case-for-support-final/","section":"post","summary":"Project Title: clinAIcan - developing clinical applications of artificial intelligence for cancer\nTrack Record [max 2 pages] I am an Artificial Intelligence (AI) researcher with a focus on developing computational and statistical methodologies for problems within the biomedical and health sciences.\nResearch Contributions.
