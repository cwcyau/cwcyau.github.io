Real problems inspired and underpin the methodological research I do and getting to grips with real scientific investigations and experiments grounds the research in reality.\nMy approach is normally Bayesian using formal probabilistic methods. This gives methods a coherent development framework allowing for greater rigour in model evaluation.\nI believe in a multi-disciplinary approach which involves working with and training not only statistical and machine learning scientists but also those from a biomedical, social science or clinical background.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"https://cwcyau.github.io/author/christopher-yau/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/christopher-yau/","section":"authors","summary":"I am Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Oxford in a joint position between Nuffield Department for Women’s and Reproductive Health and the Nuffield Department of Population Health.

For official information about the funding schemes discussed please refer to the NIHR website.\nThis guide is intended for those from UK-based research communities who are not familiar with NIHR funding particularly those doing mathematical and computational sciences and who focus more on foundational methods research.\nBackground The Better Methods, Better Research (BMBR) programme funds methodological research to ensure that optimal research methods are used in biomedical, health, and care-focused research, policy, and delivery. It is one of the few UK funding schemes dedicated to methodology development — whether qualitative or quantitative. Specifically methods must be applicable beyond a single case study or research question and should also be developed with end-user engagement.\nIn late 2024, BMBR transitioned from being operated by the Medical Research Council (MRC) to the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR). This change brought several important differences for applicants and award holders familiar with the MRC/UKRI model. Some of these may be particularly unfamiliar to those from mathematical and computational science backgrounds.\nI created this unofficial guide to help researchers interested in applying. Practical advice can be hard to find, and having previously served as a BMBR funding panel member (under MRC) and as a successful applicant in the first NIHR-led round (you can read my research protocol here), I hope my insights will be useful.\nWho Are the Funders? NIHR and MRC derive their budgets from different sources:\nMRC is part of UKRI, which primarily receives funding from the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT).\nNIHR is primarily funded by the Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC).\nBroadly speaking, MRC focuses on basic biomedical discovery and early translation, while NIHR’s remit extends further into applied and translational research, including clinical trials and experimental medicine studies.\nFor BMBR applicants, this distinction matters. NIHR’s systems and terminology have evolved primarily around applied studies. Some of its processes, language, and structures are therefore not optimised for methods research.\nDon’t be discouraged, though — methods research remains firmly within the BMBR remit.\nGrant or Contract? A key difference between NIHR and MRC funding lies in the nature of the award. NIHR issues contracts, not grants.\nThis means the process is more formal, with a stronger emphasis on accountability and legal enforceability regarding the work undertaken. These contractual implications permeate the application, award setup, and project monitoring stages.\nIf you’re used to the relative flexibility of UKRI grants, NIHR contracts can feel more restrictive and administratively demanding. However, NIHR Programme Managers are available throughout your contract to support delivery and help resolve challenges.\nThe system is designed to motivate researchers and ensure projects — particularly those involving multiple collaborators — stay on track and meet their agreed milestones.\nIf you really dislike oversight or have a deep aversion to administration, NIHR funding may not be the best fit.\nApplying Under NIHR, BMBR applications have become longer and more detailed than their previous MRC equivalents. This reflects NIHR’s broader framework and the contractual nature of its awards.\nYour application serves as a foundation for the future contract and monitoring process, so you’ll need to define clear objectives and timelines — these will later translate directly into milestones for project monitoring.\nIt is more work than a typical UKRI application, but this extra detail often results in stronger, more carefully planned proposals — particularly regarding public and patient involvement and engagement (PPIE).\nBecause your proposed timescales will form the basis of your contractual milestones, be realistic. Discuss risks and mitigation plans, and focus on tangible deliverables.\nImportantly do not forget the lay or non-technical summary. This is often left to the last step by many applicants but remember this piece of text is not just read b Public-Patient Involvement and Engagement representatives, but also by NIHR staff, reviewers and panelists who may not be expert in your area (but may have influence on the decision to recommend funding!) and even experts who just do not have a lot of time! It is important that this summary captures the main features of your proposal succinctly and powerfully.\nNIHR provides comprehensive guidance for applicants — if you follow their structure closely, you won’t go far wrong.\nPublic and Patient Involvement and Engagement (PPIE) PPIE can seem daunting for foundational methods researchers.

This allows the model to update its knowledge efficiently while maintaining stability, accuracy, and uncertainty awareness — even when past data cannot be retained.\nThe method unifies multiple continual-learning scenarios (such as learning new classes or tasks) within a single Bayesian framework. It provides interpretable, uncertainty-calibrated predictions and avoids catastrophic forgetting through principled distributional regularization rather than data replay.\nAcross image-recognition and biomedical benchmarks — including The Cancer Genome Atlas and Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor datasets — CL-BRUNO outperforms existing exemplar-free approaches while offering stronger privacy protection and more trustworthy probabilistic outputs.\nIn short, this work shows that continual learning can be both data-efficient and privacy-conscious, paving the way for reliable AI systems that evolve safely in dynamic, real-world environments.\nLead Investigator:\nChristopher Yau Hanwen Xing ","date":1760745600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1760745600,"objectID":"7c8a653fc7b33e69c216b5a7ff69e382","permalink":"https://cwcyau.github.io/event/continual-learn/","publishdate":"2025-10-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/continual-learn/","section":"event","summary":"CL-BRUNO, a new framework for continual learning","tags":["Machine Learning"],"title":"Continual Learning via Probabilistic Exchangeable Sequence Modelling","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":["machine learning","health"],"content":"Congratulations to Mortiz Gogl whose paper “DoseSurv: Predicting Personalized Survival Outcomes under Continuous-Valued Treatments” was accepted for NeurIPS 2025.

In order to balance these competing demands, we have developed a novel statistical framework for unsupervised clustering, named Rarity, that enables the discovery process for rare cell types to be more robust, consistent, and interpretable. We achieve this by devising a novel clustering method based on a Bayesian latent variable model in which we assign cells to inferred latent binary on/off expression profiles. This lets us achieve increased sensitivity to rare cell populations while also allowing us to control and interpret potential false positive discoveries. We systematically study the challenges associated with rare cell type identification and demonstrate the utility of Rarity on various IMC datasets.\nImplementation of Rarity together with examples is available from the Github repository (https://github.com/kasparmartens/rarity).\n","date":1702425600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1702425600,"objectID":"7ce35ee808592732247981832fc5270a","permalink":"https://cwcyau.github.io/post/2023-12-13_rarity_2023/","publishdate":"2023-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/2023-12-13_rarity_2023/","section":"post","summary":"Congratulations to Kaspar Martens on having his paper accepted in Bioinformatics.\nCell type identification plays an important role in the analysis and interpretation of single-cell data and can be carried out via supervised or unsupervised clustering approaches.

Through early detection, it may be possible to take actions to minimise future disease severity or even prevent disease occurrence altogether. However, while the general concept is readily accepted, putting early detection into practice is often far from straightforward.\nIn this post, I will outline some ideas that can underpin a conceptual framework for developing early detection markers and point out some common mistakes. This is intended to provide a non-technical guide to some principles that might stimulate suitable study designs in the future.\nDisease progression First, I will introduce some terminology to make this discussion clearer. There will be frequent use of the phrase disease progression to describe how a condition begins and typically worsens over time. I will also use the term disease state to refer to the severity of a condition at any one moment in time. Therefore, as a disease progresses, the disease state changes. I will often refer to four different phases of disease progression:\nPre-disease which describes the period before the onset of the condition. Early stage disease which covers the period between the onset of the disease and the earliest signs that the condition may have started to manifest. Established disease typically describing the period when patients would likely be first diagnosed after clear symptoms have appeared and treatment is necessary. Finally, late stage disease which occurs after the disease has evolved and new courses of treatments are required. The long-term quality of life for the patient maybe severely diminished. The type of diseases that we will be thinking about are chronic conditions (e.g. dementia) or disorders such as cancer. Short-term conditions are not part of this discussion.\nDetecting disease Identifying a disease requires the ability to measure some quantity, known as a marker, which is related to the disease state. The marker can be directly related to the disease, e.g. the size of a tumour on a CT scan, or an indirect marker such as an assessment of cognitive abilities in individuals with dementia. Markers that can directly measure disease state are preferred but indirect measurements may be the only pragmatic option in many situations.\nThe detection window refers to the period when the magnitude of the marker exceeds a threshold and it is possible to detect the presence (or absence) of the marker (i.e. the minimum size of a breast tumour that can be seen on a mammogram). The detection window should be as wide as possible to give the best chance of picking up the disease. For early detection, it is necessary for the detection window to overlap with the early onset of the disease and the opportunity window which is the period during which it maybe possible to intervene and influence the course of the disease progression (ideally, prevent it).\nFigure 1. An illustration of the terminology used in this article with the four phases of disease progression and the ideal placing of the opportunity and detection windows to enable early detection of disease. Types of early detection markers In terms of their potential for early detection, disease markers can broadly be classified into one of two forms (i) progressive and (ii) transient markers.\nProgressive markers track the progression of the disease from early-onset to late-stage (Figure 1). They increase (or decrease) over time with the severity of the condition and do not ordinarily improve unless there is some medical intervention. The detection window opens as soon as the markers exceeds a certain threshold and does not close. For early detection, progressive markers should reach the detection threshold during the early phases of the disease giving the largest detection window possible.\nFigure 2. Progressive markers gradually increase as the disease worsens, activating early during disease progression to give a large detection window that maximises the chance of overlapping with the opportunity window. Transient markers are linked to features of the disease that are only active during certain periods of disease progression. The detection window is therefore bounded by both the period in which the marker is active and the detection threshold. As with progressive markers, the detection window for a transient marker ideally occupies an early phase of disease and overlaps the opportunity window.\nFigure 3. An ideal transient marker activates at an early disease stage and during the opportunity window. Common mistakes Not all valid markers are “early detection markers” When developing a marker for early detection it is absolutely crucial to understand the corresponding detection window and its relation to the opportunity window. For progressive markers, if the detection window does not overlap with early disease on-set and/or the opportunity window, the …","date":1683590400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1683590400,"objectID":"8617c72125c07e24eea97fb7fe9d639d","permalink":"https://cwcyau.github.io/post/earlydetection/","publishdate":"2023-05-09T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/earlydetection/","section":"post","summary":"The early detection of diseases is a highly desirable approach for addressing conditions where late stage disease cannot be easily treated or managed.

We hope to get survey responses from over 300 PhD students so please help us by sparing 10-15 minutes of your time to answer some questions.\nResponses received before 15 July 2022 will be entered into a prize draw for a selection of £30 Amazon eGift cards.\nAfter 30 July 2022, data gathered through the survey will be analysed and a written report produced for distribution in September 2022.\nWhy another survey?\nThe purpose of this survey is to improve our understanding of your motivations for doing a PhD, what you want to and are getting out of it, and where you want to go next. We know the world looks very different for data scientists than when I was doing my PhD so, with many exciting and lucrative opportunities coming from different parts of the ecosystem, what is the purpose of the PhD? What makes it an attractive qualification to have still?\nWe know that the experience of PhD students varies due to several factors but – as data scientists - we need more detailed data to better understand and quantitatively characterise those variations. The survey information that will be collected will help us inform discussions with universities and funders to develop new strategies and approaches for doctoral training in the UK and to cater for changing needs.\nWhat is the definition of data science being used? Who should take part?\nIf you spend a large part of your research analysing real-world data, building computational models, or developing novel computer algorithms for analysing data then you should complete this survey. It does not matter if you are working on proteins, geology, or plasma physics, if it involves data then please complete this survey. If you largely work on theory and/or simulations relevant to data science but not much with data itself, we are keen to hear from you too.\nAre there questions you’ve forgotten?\nWe tried to include as many questions as possible without making the survey too laborious. There are many issues and topics we could have addressed but we made tough choices to focus on these key areas of interest.\nWhy is the last section only on health?\nThis survey is being conducted in partnership with Health Data Research UK – the national institute for health data research. They have a particular focus on health data science and consequently we have added a few questions on this area of work. However, though the findings will be directly linked to health data science, the responses should reveal insights into how inter-/multi-disciplinary research and career transitions are being supported.\nWhat about stipends and the cost-of-living crisis?\nWe are deeply aware that UK PhD students are struggling with the current cost-of-living crisis and the impact of the real terms reduction in spending power offered by typical studentship stipends. We are not able to affect the decisions that must be taken by funders to address these issues but we hope that the survey information could shed light on some of the wider challenges faced by students in addition to financial support.\nWhy only UK?\nWe would love to conduct a global survey but academic systems across the globe work quite differently and, as UK-based researchers working in the UK, it seems fitting that we would explore the nation in which we live.\nWhat will you do with the data?\nWe will use the survey data to generate a report detailing our survey findings by September 2022. This will be disseminated publicly. All surveys are collected anonymously except where individuals choose to provide their name and e-mail address to be entered for the prize draw. Names and e-mail addresses submitted will only be used for this purpose and will not be shared for the analysis of the main survey data or for distribution.\n","date":1656979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656979200,"objectID":"3298e69d3e1e283ef80a584bfcff81a2","permalink":"https://cwcyau.github.io/post/greatphdsurvey/","publishdate":"2022-07-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/greatphdsurvey/","section":"post","summary":"What am I doing?\nMy name is Christopher Yau and I am Professor of Artificial Intelligence at the University of Oxford and Health Data Research UK.\nI am carrying out a survey of UK PhD students who are working in any area of data science and I need your help!

grab","type":"post"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Introduction Christopher Yau is a co-investigator in the BIRM-CAM project that is led by Professors Tom Marshall (University of Birmingham) and Sylvia Richardson (MRC Biostatistics Unit, University of Cambridge).\nMultimorbidity Multimorbidity is when people suffer from more than one long-term illness. It is increasingly common as people live longer. It is important because individual illnesses have knock-on effects on others, it is more complex managing multiple than single illnesses, and multimorbid patients are heavy users of medications and health services.\nTo understand multimorbidity we need to know which illnesses tend to occur together and which illness combinations most affect health. To adapt health services we need to know which types of people develop multimorbidity: their age, sex, ethnicity, socio-economic status and whether they tend to live in the same households. To learn how to prevent it we need to identify lifestyle factors (physical activity, diet, smoking, alcohol) linked to multimorbidity and the measurements (laboratory test results, weight, blood pressure) that might be early signs.\nElectronic Health Records Electronic health records are a good source of information on multimorbidity because they include information on the same patient over many years. They include information on illnesses, medications, hospital admissions; measurements (laboratory tests, weight, blood pressure) and lifestyle (smoking, alcohol). Previous research has studied multimorbidity using a variety of statistical methods. It finds some illnesses, such as diabetes and heart disease tend to occur together. But different statistical methods often find different groups of illnesses. We need a single, consistent approach to this type of analysis to ensure we are researching the same groups of illnesses. Previous research generally has not made best use of all the available information. For example, patients are considered either to have or not have diabetes but research did not make use of laboratory measurements (such as blood glucose) identifying some people as likely to develop diabetes. Previous research grouped illnesses according to how commonly they occur together, without giving any special significance to combinations of illnesses linked to risk of death or hospital admission. Clearly such combinations of illness are of more importance. There are more advanced analysis methods which can address these and other shortcomings.\nThe Research The first part of our research will develop methods of data analysis. We will review research on different statistical methods for grouping illnesses together. We will hold a workshop involving leading UK researchers in the field to try to agree on the best approach to this type of analysis. Informed by this we will analyse two large databases of electronic health records, each including several million patients. In each database we will identify the groups of illnesses that co-occur and check our findings in the other database. This is considered good practice in analysis. At the end of this step we will produce software to analyse and find groups of illnesses in electronic health records and make this freely available for other researchers to use.\nThe next part of our research will use additional information from two large surveys. Both surveys include details not always available in health records e.g. occupation, diet, lifestyle and measures of frailty. One includes 500,000 people the other has information on the same people over a period of 14 years. We will describe the consequences for patients of different combinations of illnesses: their levels of frailty because it is linked to need for social care; development of further illnesses; medications, use of health services and death. We will work with patient advisors to help guide analysis of patients journeys through health services. We will investigate possible causes of multimorbidity including people’s social circumstances, the environment, lifestyle (smoking, alcohol, diet and exercise) and laboratory test results that might help indicate causes. This step will point to the areas of environment and lifestyle which should be investigated further as possible causes.\n","date":1569888000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569888000,"objectID":"3f812b6f18b24cd3e72e112a2e61de0e","permalink":"https://cwcyau.github.io/event/birmcam/","publishdate":"2019-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/birmcam/","section":"event","summary":"Bringing Innovative Research Methods to Clustering Analysis of Multimorbidity  (BIRM-CAM) project between the Universities of Birmingham and Cambridge funded by the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) and the National Institute for Health Research (NIHR).","tags":["Multimorbidity","Electronic Health Records","Digital Health"],"title":"BIRM-CAM","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":["health data","phd"],"content":"The Wellcome Trust have funded a new HDRUK-Turing Wellcome PhD programme in Health Data Science which will be jointly directed by Christopher Yau.

New and maturing technological developments hold the potential to have a transformative effect on health service delivery. Digital health solutions can aid in the reduction of waiting times, more effective use of limited resources and improved treatment fidelity but, once such technologies are implemented, the dearth of data that can be acquired through their adoption itself presents a challenge. Data-driven insights, driven by machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, can offer a glimpse of previously unknown patterns and identify opportunities for the development of new healthcare practices or policies. As digital health platforms become more sophisticated, the data that can be acquired often becomes more complex and heterogeneous, machine-based interpretation becomes a near-necessity.\nThe Breaking Free Group is a leading digital health and behaviour science company. Founded in 2010, it is formed from a team of psychologists, substance misuse experts and technology specialists. With an organisational philosophy built around the principles of state-of-the-art behaviour science and the UK Medical Research Council evaluation framework, they have developed a bespoke digital behavioural intervention platform that provides 24/7 access to a secure, GDPR-compliant, online digital cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) platform with a particular focus on substance misuse. Users of the platform complete pre- and post-therapy questionnaires and interactive exercises designed to teach strategies to overcome addictive behaviours and improve wellbeing. Scoring on questionnaire responses can signpost users to personalised information sources. Real-time quantitative data from the platform can be anonymously fed to health service providers and commissioners for planning and policy development purposes.\nBreaking Free has seen its digital platform commissioned for use by the Ministry of Justice in UK prisons, Non-Government Charitable Organisations and NHS Trusts. Uniquely, Breaking Free operates under a research ethics protocol approved by the NHS Health Research Authority and endorsement by the National Institute of Clinical Excellence allowing the data they collect to be utilised for broader research applications. More recently, two new online platforms have been deployed more widely to the public targeting alcohol consumption reduction and smoking cessation. Breaking Free are based in both Birmingham and Manchester.\nWe have initiated a new multi-disciplinary collaboration with the Breaking Free Online team to develop novel data science methodologies to exploit real-time digital health monitoring and intervention data. Our working exemplars will be based on the unique behavioural insights captured by the Breaking Free Group but the research outputs would have generic applicability in other related settings including youth mental health conditions.\n","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"9dc465fd466943ad5ada681fb12c150c","permalink":"https://cwcyau.github.io/event/breaking-free/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/breaking-free/","section":"event","summary":"The Data Science of Digital Behaviour Intervention","tags":["Mental Health","Digital Health","Behavioural Science"],"title":"Breaking Free with Artificial Intelligence","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Mutation signatures are the hallmarks of mutagenic processes in cancer that can provide clues about the biochemical mechanisms by which DNA is altered in cancer.

A mechanistic understanding can be postulated based on time-course multi-omics genome-wide measurements.\nWe developed a novel Bayesian nonparametric regression approach called Multi-Omics NETwork inference (MONET) for high-dimensionality multi-modal data integration to quantify the temporally dependent forces driving development and investigate by perturbation effects. Sparsity-inducing priors regularise the TF-gene interaction network and a Dirichlet process prior to regulate the number of participating TFs. This gives rise to a Bayesian nonparametric model where the number of TFs are learnt from data and not specified a priori. Statistical inference is performed in a Bayesian setting using an implementation of Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC)-derived No-U Turn Sampler (NUTS) in STAN.\nWe show that MONET is able to extract accurate time-dependent TF-gene interaction networks and assess the importance of each TF for the different stages in haematopoietic development. Our model allows us to make predictions on the importance of specific TF over time and under different perturbation settings.

These low-dimensional representations can provide some insight into patterns within datasets but their interpretation relies on how these map back on the original feature set. However the latter requires interpreting what the decoder network has learnt which makes it challenging.\nIn this project, we have focused on understanding the sources of variation in Conditional VAEs. Our goal is to decompose the feature-level variation in high-dimensional data through disentanglement of additive and interactions effects of latent variables and fixed inputs. We propose to achieve this through the Neural Decomposition - an adaptation of the well-known concept of variance decomposition from classical statistics to deep learning models.

In collaboration with Ciccarelli Lab at the Francis Crick Institute we have developed a machine learning algorithm to identify cancer genes in individual patients considering all types of damaging alterations simultaneously. Analysing 261 EACs from the OCCAMS Consortium, we discover helper genes that, alongside well-known drivers, promote cancer. We confirm the robustness of our approach in 107 additional EACs. Unlike recurrent alterations of known drivers, these cancer helper genes are rare or patient-specific. However, they converge towards perturbations of well-known cancer processes. Recurrence of the same process perturbations, rather than individual genes, divides EACs into six clusters differing in their molecular and clinical features. Experimentally mimicking the alterations of predicted helper genes in cancer and pre-cancer cells validates their contribution to disease progression, while reverting their alterations reveals EAC acquired dependencies that can be exploited in therapy.\nResearchers:\nJoel Nulsen Hrvoje Misetic ","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"4e354ed7d5e36fee3bc10f1ebfb7bde9","permalink":"https://cwcyau.github.io/event/cancer-drivers/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/event/cancer-drivers/","section":"event","summary":"Identification of cancer-promoting genetic alterations using genome sequencing and machine learning.","tags":["Bioinformatics","Genomics","Cancer"],"title":"Precision medicine and individual-level cancer driver genes","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"40f24918677e610f8d720be378ce27cd","permalink":"https://cwcyau.github.io/publication/consort-2019-reporting/","publishdate":"2025-08-07T20:48:45.434466Z","relpermalink":"/publication/consort-2019-reporting/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Reporting guidelines for clinical trials evaluating artificial intelligence interventions are needed","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Genomic copy number evolution in cancer refers to the acquisition or loss of genome segments over time due to mutational processes in cancer that result in the loss of biological mechanisms for the maintenance of genome integrity in cells.

However, as our capability to generate experimental data improves, our ability to conceive of appropriate mathematical descriptions to describe biological phenomena has become a bottleneck.\nThe goal of machine learning is to “learn” complex dependencies automatically within data sets. Neural networks (NNs) have been at the forefront of recent advances by offering a means of parametrising complex functional mapping between data and its representations.\nNovel computational machinery have enabled NN approaches to scale to the analysis of unprecedently large datasets and provide versatility over standard modelling approaches. However, despite their successes in a range of applications, in biomedical research, NNs are often derided for their “black box” discoveries, lack of interpretability and the need for unrealistic quantities of training data. Such criticisms often overlook the fact that default NN structures express no explicit assumptions about the problems on which they are applied and they are often used as generic data mining devices for discovery purposes.\nNonetheless, there is a clear opportunity for the development of novel NN approaches that combine scalability and versatility with the capability of learning the physically realistic constraints that are embedded in hand-crafted mathematical models.\nThis project seeks to investigate the methodological foundations for what could form an Automated BioData Scientist (AutoBioDataSci) platform. We would like to develop learning algorithms that can capture biological laws and encapsulate them in such a way that such knowledge can be transfer to new problems. This major project involves inter-linking representation learning theory with transfer and meta-learning as well as having its roots embedded in the biological scientific discovery

the Ovarian Cancer Cell Laboratory led by Professor Ahmed Ahsour Ahmed to unlock the molecular mechanisms underlying high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) using genomics and bioinformatics.\nPremalignant SOX2 overexpression in the fallopian tubes of ovarian cancer patients We have discovered premalignant overexpression of SOX2 in the fallopian tubes of ovarian cancer patients which was nearly ubiquitous in HGSOCs. This was also a common feature in women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations prior to ovarian cancer initiation. Thus, our data has important implications for screening, although it will need additional clinical evaluation to test the feasibility of quantitative detection of SOX2 expression or the expression of its downstream targets for this purpose. You can read the original research paper here as well as media reports here and here.\nThe unmasking non-genetic heterogeneity through by single-cell sequencing of fallopian tube epithelial cells More recently, we have used single cell sequencing to understand the inter-differentiation between cell states which promotes cancer cell survival under stress and fosters non-genetic heterogeneity (NGH). NGH is a surrogate of tumor resilience but its quantification is confounded by genetic heterogeneity. We showed that NGH can be accurately measured when informed by the molecular signatures of the normal cells of origin. We surveyed the transcriptomes of 4000 normal fallopian tube epithelial (FTE) cells, the cells of origin of serous ovarian cancer, and identified six FTE subtypes. We used subtype signatures to deconvolute SOC expression data and found substantial intra-tumor NGH that was previously unrecognized. Importantly, NGH-based stratification of ∼1700 tumors robustly predicted survival. Our findings lay the foundation for accurate prognostic and therapeutic stratification of SOC. You can read our Cancer Cell paper here and press coverage from Daily Mail.\nResearchers:\nZhiyuan Hu

for cancer\nTrack Record [max 2 pages] I am an Artificial Intelligence (AI) researcher with a focus on developing computational and statistical methodologies for problems within the biomedical and health sciences.\nResearch Contributions. In Statistics and Machine Learning, my major contributions have included i) expanding the statistical toolkit for Markov models, ii) Bayesian nonparametric latent variable modelling for high-dimensional data and iii) novel methodology for bioinformatics. A significant feature of my work is the synthesis of statistical and machine learning principles. I routinely published in both the major machine learning conferences (NeurIPS, ICML, AISTATS) [@aueb2014hamming; @law2017testing; @rukat2017bayesian; @rukat2018probabilistic; @martens2019decomposing; @martens2019ens; @martens2020nd; @martens2020trans] as well as the most prominent statistical journals (JASA, JRSSB) [@yau2011bayesian; @titsias2016statistical; @titsias2017hamming] cross-fertilising ideas from both domains. These accomplishments have been made while my primary role has been as a Principal Investigator within medical faculties with responsibilities for a genomic medicine research programme that studies human disease - in particular, cancer. This has involved supervision of experimental scientists, experimental design as well as direct funding of these efforts. I have therefore developed an array of integrated collaborations with biological and clinical research groups within which my team has been embedded to carry out this work.\nAcademic Citizenship. For the last five years, I have focused on my young family which has limited my availability for international travel and collaborations. During this period I have focused on supporting early career researchers in my group and to maximise my national identity through participation in a number of UK initiatives. This platform gives me a strong basis to utilise this Fellowship to accelerate my progress to an international leader in AI.\nGenomics England. I founded and co-lead the Quantitative Methods, Machine Learning and Functional Genomics Clinical Interpretation Partnership (GeCIP) for the Genomics England (GEL) 100,000 Genomes Project (100KGP) with Professor Martin Tobin (Leicester). This involves coordinating and reviewing 100KGP research activities across a national network of researchers on behalf of GEL as well as membership of the scientific steering committee giving me deep insight into the developing genomic medicine landscape in England. My work also involves advocacy for genomic medicine, for example, I have recently contributed to the PHG Foundation report on \u0026#34;Artificial intelligence for genomic medicine\u0026#34; as well as organising an upcoming workshop on Machine Learning and AI with GSK (due to held in July 2020).\nHealth Data Research UK/Alan Turing Institute. In 2019, I co-led (with Professor Peter Diggle) a successful application on behalf of the Health Data Research UK (HDRUK) and The Alan Turing Institute (Turing) for a Wellcome PhD Programme in Health Data Science. This is a unique multi-institutional PhD programme1 that is founded on HDRUK’s One Institute vision of collective and collaborative working in health data science. I am work package co-lead for artificial intelligence and multimodal data integration in the HDRUK Multi-omics Consortium with Dr Michael Inouye (Cambridge). I am also Principal Investigator of a Turing Health Programme project, funded by a Strategic Priorities Fund AI for Science and Government award, which provides matched support for the work.\nFLIER. I am a member of the Taskforce, consisting of senior academic, government, NHS and industry representatives, that developed the Academy of Medical Sciences (AMS) Future Leaders in Enterprise and Research (FLIER) Leadership Programme. Here, I was able to utilise my analytical and influencing skills to shape the format of the programme, challenging our senior leaders to improve their understanding of the needs of those in middle career stages and to boost the inclusivity and diversity ambitions of this programme, in particular, by advocating the needs of women in science.\nOther Activities. I am a member of the steering group for the international CONSORT/SPIRIT-AI consortium where we are developing new guidelines for the evaluation of AI-driven health interventions in randomised control trials [@liu2019reporting]. I am applying knowledge from this initiative as part of my contribution to the Phase 4 review panel for the AI in Health and Care Award run by the AAC in partnership with NHSX and NIHR. I also sit on the MRC Methodology Research Panel where I have contributed to the development of MRC’s data science strategy for its next funding cycle.\nResearcher Development.
